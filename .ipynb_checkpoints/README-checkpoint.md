# EDS220 Final Project: Accessing iNaturalist Data Using GBIF
This repository is for our tutuorial for using data from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facilitiy (GBIF)](gbif.org). In this tutorial, we will be using an occurrence dataset about [iNaturalist Research Grade Observations](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7). This ReadMe will include an installation guide to get started using GBIF. 

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with the tutorial for EDS 220 Working With Environmental Data at UC Santa Barbara (Fall 2021 quarter). 

## Installation Guide
You will need to make an account with GBIF to download data from their database. 

You will also need to to install the package pygif to work with data from this data base and can use the following commands:
