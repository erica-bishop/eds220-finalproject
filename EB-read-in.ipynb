Charakteristisch für den Adeliepinguin ist der schwarze Kopf, der weiße Ring rund um das Auge und der verhältnismäßig klein wirkende Schnabel. Neben dem Kaiserpinguin ist er die einzige Pinguinart, die auf dem Hauptteil des antarktischen Kontinents vorkommt. Eine im Rossmeer befindliche Brutkolonie dieser Art gilt sogar als die südlichste Pinguinkolonie weltweit.Pütz und Reinke-Kunze, S. 26 Benannt ist die Art nach der Frau des französischen Polarforschers Jules Dumont d’Urville. Es werden keine Unterarten für diese Art unterschieden. Die IUCN stuft den Adeliepinguin derzeit als ungefährdet (least concern) ein.Factsheet auf BirdLife International'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'miniatur|Adeliepinguine auf einem Eisberg Der Bestand wurde 2014 auf 7,58 Millionen Brutvögel geschätzt. Der Bestand gilt als stabil bis leicht zunehmend. Alle Brutkolonien der Ross-See nahmen beispielsweise zwischen 1981 und 1988 zwischen 3 und 30 Prozent zu. Die Zunahmen hängen möglicherweise mit einem steigenden Nahrungsangebot durch die Erwärmung der südlichen Ozeane zusammen. Auf der Antarktischen Halbinsel, wo diese Erwärmung nicht so ausgeprägt ist, sind die Zunahmen weniger deutlich. Hier haben die Bestände leicht zugenommen, nachdem dort vor allem das Sammeln von Eiern eingestellt wurde. 2017 wurde auf den Danger-Inseln eine bis dahin unbekannte Population von rund 1,5 Mio. Adeliepinguinen entdeckt. Grundsätzlich sind Adeliepinguine sehr empfindlich gegenüber Störungen durch den Menschen. Dort wo Forschungsstationen wie beispielsweise auf Kap Royds errichtet wurden, gingen die Bestände zurück. Sie erholten sich erst wieder, nachdem strengere Regeln die Störungen durch den Menschen dort begrenzten.'},\n",

Es besteht kein auffälliger Sexualdimorphismus, allerdings sind Weibchen etwas kleiner als die Männchen. Weibchen wiegen zwischen 3,9 und 4,7 Kilogramm, Männchen erreichen ein Gewicht zwischen 4,3 und 5,3 Kilogramm.Williams, S. 171 Das Gefieder weist keine jahreszeitlichen Variationen auf, Jungvögel lassen sich bis zu einem Alter von einem Jahr von den adulten Vögeln unterscheiden.Williams, S. 169 Adulte Adeliepinguine haben einen blauschwarzen Kopf und eine blauschwarze Körperoberseite. Kurz vor der Mauser wirkt das abgenutzte Gefieder allerdings bräunlich. Rund um das Auge verläuft ein auffälliger weißer Hautring. Außerdem ist die Körperunterseite weiß, Kinn und Kehle sind schwarz und scharf von der weißen Brust abgesetzt. Die zu Flossen umgestalteten Flügel sind auf der Oberseite schwarz und auf der Unterseite weiß mit einem dunklen Fleck am Flossenende. Der Schnabel ist überwiegend schwarz, lediglich an der Schnabelbasis hellt er zu einem orangerot auf. Er wirkt sehr kurz, weil er über die Hälfte von Federn bedeckt ist.Shirihai, S. 63 Die Iris ist braun. Die Beine und Füße sind mattweiß bis rosafarbenen, die Sohlen sind schwarz.Williams, S. 170 Die Mauser durchlaufen die Adeliepinguine kurz nach dem Flüggewerden der Jungvögel. Jungvögel haben bis zu einem Alter von etwa 14 Monaten eine weiße Kehle und einen schwarzen Augenring. Adeliepinguine können mit ihrem dunklen Gesicht und dem Fehlen von verlängerten Kopffedern mit keiner anderen Pinguinart verwechselt werden. Jungvögel weisen Ähnlichkeit mit dem Zügelpinguin auf, jedoch weisen Adeliepinguine kein Weiß oberhalb der Augen auf und haben keine schwarzen Gefiederpartien unterhalb des Kinns.Williams, S. 172'},\n",

Die Fortpflanzungsperiode setzt ein, sobald die Küstengewässer eine Temperatur über dem Gefrierpunkt erreicht haben. Die Küstengewässer sind zum Beginn der Brutzeit häufig noch mit Eis bedeckt und Adeliepinguine müssen häufig Eisbarrieren überwinden, um ihre Brutkolonien erreichen zu können.Sirihai, S. 64 und S. 65 Adeliepinguine leben und brüten in Kolonien, die oft beträchtliche Ausmaße annehmen können. Brutkolonien finden sich auf felsigen Inseln, Halbinseln und Küstenabschnitten, die eisfrei sind. Die südlichsten Kolonien befinden sich häufig an Stellen, die sowohl sonnen- als auch windexponiert sind und deswegen frei von Schneewehen bleiben. Weiter nördlich präferieren Adeliepinguine geschütztere Standorte für ihre Brutkolonien. Auf der Ross-Insel gibt es eine Kolonie von Adeliepinguinen mit ca. einer halben Million Individuen. Sie sind sehr ortstreu. Im antarktischen Sommer leben sie auf dem Festland, sonst am Rande der offenen Packeiszone. Ihre Bestandsstärke wird auf ca. 20 Millionen Tiere geschätzt. Die Brutperiode dieser Pinguine beginnt im Oktober. Die Weibchen legen in die aus zusammengehäuften Steinen bestehenden Nester ihre Eier und gehen danach wieder auf Nahrungssuche. Das Brüten übernehmen allein die Männchen. Bis zum Schlüpfen der Jungen nach 35 Tagen fressen diese nichts. Sind die Jungen geschlüpft, kehren die Weibchen zurück, um bei der Aufzucht zu helfen. Im Alter von zwei bis drei Wochen schließen sich die Jungvögel zu Kindergruppen oder sogenannten Kindergärten zusammen. Das ermöglicht es beiden Elternvögeln, nach Futter zu suchen. Jungvögel sind besonders empfindlich gegenüber Klimaeinflüssen. Die Mortalitätsrate unter den Jungvögeln steigt besonders deutlich an, wenn der Schnee schmilzt, so dass die Daunenfedern der Nestlinge nass werden.Shirihai, S. 65 Männchen ohne Partnerin schließen sich, zumindest teilweise, zu Gruppen zusammen und zeigen aggressives sexuelles Verhalten gegenüber Jungtieren oder töten und verletzen Weibchen.Douglas G.D.

       "    {'description': 'Adeliepinguine leben überwiegend von kleinen Krustentieren und nehmen außerdem kleine Fische zu sich. Sie finden ihre Beute in der Regel in Gewässertiefen zwischen zehn und vierzig Meter, sind aber in der Lage, bis zu 170 Meter zu tauchen. Rund vierzig Prozent der Tauchzeit wird in Gewässertiefen von weniger als 12,5 Meter verbracht. In den weiter nördlich gelegenen Brutkolonien suchen sie während der Fortpflanzungszeit nur während des Tages nach Nahrung. In den südlicheren Brutkolonien suchen sie ganztägig nach Nahrung. Die Dauer, während der Adeliepinguine nach Nahrung suchen, variiert sehr stark abhängig vom Standort der Brutkolonie und dem dortigen Angebot an Nahrung. Am Kap Bird, dem nördlichsten Ausläufer der Ross-Insel, entfernen sich Adeliepinguine während der Brutzeit für neun bis 25 Tage, um nach Nahrung zu suchen. Entfernungen von bis zu 100 Kilometer von der Brutkolonie konnten nachgewiesen werden. Während der Aufzucht der Jungvögel halten sich die Adeliepinguine näher an der Brutkolonie auf. Etwas mehr als die Hälfte der Brutvögel entfernen sich nicht mehr als 10 Kilometer von der Kolonie. Brutvögel der Béchervaise Island entfernten sich während der Brutzeit bis zu 341 Kilometer, während der Jungenaufzucht dagegen nicht mehr als zwölf Kilometer. Zur Brutkolonie zurückkehrende Adeliepinguine legen zwischen 2,2 und 3,4 Kilometer pro Stunde zurück, solange das Ei noch bebrütet wird. Adeliepinguine, die bereits einen Jungvogel aufziehen, erreichen Geschwindigkeiten zwischen 3,2 und 4,6 Kilometer pro Stunde.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Der Kontaktruf des Adeliepinguins ist ein kurzes Bellen, das lautmalerisch mit aark umschrieben wird. Dieser Ruf, der etwa 0,3 Sekunden währt, ist auch von Adeliepinguinen zu hören, die sich auf offener See befinden. Zu den Drohlauten gehört eine Art Knurren, das häufig von Seitenblicken zu einem anderen Pinguin begleitet ist. Es ist besonders dann zu hören, wenn ein anderer Pinguin in das unmittelbare Brutrevier eindringt. Bevor Adeliepinguine nach anderen Pinguinen hacken, äußern sie einen ähnlichen kurzen Laut, der noch etwas harscher als der Drohlaut klingt. Grunzende grr oder gwarr-Laute sind zu hören, wenn sie mit einem anderen Vogel kämpfen. Die Lautäußerungen der Adeliepinguine, die sie während der Werbung um den Partnervogel hören lassen, sind sehr vielseitig. Ein rhythmischer, drei bis sieben Sekunden langer Ruf gehört zum Balzverhalten des Adeliepinguins. Er wird nur gelegentlich von den Weibchen, dagegen sehr häufig von den Männchen geäußert. Zum Balzverhalten gehören auch laute, harsche und trompetende Laute, die häufig von beiden Vögeln in der Umgebung des Nestes gerufen werden. Ein sanfter, summender Laut ist zu hören, wenn Partnervögel unmittelbar am Neststandort umeinander werben. Frisch geschlüpfte Küken geben einen schwachen Pieplaut von sich.Williams, S. 172 und S. 173'},\n",

Das Verbreitungsgebiet nichtbrütender Vögel ist nicht sehr gut erforscht. Vermutlich wandern sie nicht weiter als bis zum Rand der Packeisgrenze. Irrgäste werden gelegentlich an der südamerikanischen, australischen und neuseeländischen Küste beobachtet. Sie tauchen außerdem an subarktischen Inseln des Indischen und Pazifischen Ozeans auf.

       "   'descriptions': [{'description': \"The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is a species of penguin common along the entire coast of the Antarctic continent, which is the only place where it is found. It is the most widespread penguin species, and, along with the emperor penguin, is the most southerly distributed of all penguins. It is named after Adélie Land, in turn named for Adèle Dumont d'Urville, who was married to French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who first discovered this penguin in 1840. Adélie penguins obtain their food by both predation and foraging, with a diet of mainly krill and fish.\"},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Cape Adare In Antarctica Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a survivor of Robert Falcon Scott\\'s ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition of 1910, documented details of penguin behaviour in his book The Worst Journey in the World. \"They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children or like old men, full of their own importance...\" George Murray Levick, a Royal Navy surgeon-lieutenant and scientist who also accompanied Scott, commented on displays of selfishness among the penguins during his surveying in the Antarctic: \"At the place where they most often went in [the water], a long terrace of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice, crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.\" One writer observed how the penguin\\'s curiosity could also endanger them, which Scott found a particular nuisance: Chicks in Antarctica, with MS Explorer Others on the mission to the South Pole were more receptive of this element of the Adélies\\' curiosity. Cherry-Garrard writes: Cherry-Garrard held the birds in great regard. \"Whatever a penguin does has individuality, and he lays bare his whole life for all to see. He cannot fly away. And because he is quaint in all that he does, but still more because he is fighting against bigger odds than any other bird, and fighting always with the most gallant pluck, he comes to be considered as something apart from the ordinary bird...\" Despite their size, Adélie penguins are known for their bold and boisterous personality, and will challenge other animals, including predators far larger than them. In footage shot for the 2018 BBC Earth documentary Spy in the Snow, the boisterous behaviour of Adélie penguins was made especially apparent when an individual arrived to chase off a Southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) that had landed to threaten a group of emperor penguin chicks, in spite of the species difference between them. Adélie penguins usually swim at around 5 mph. They are able to leap some 3 m out of the water to land on rocks or ice. Food and feeding The Adélie penguin is known to feed mainly on Antarctic krill, ice krill, Antarctic silverfish, sea krill and glacial squid (diet varies depending on geographic location) during the chick-rearing season. The stable isotope record of fossil eggshell accumulated in colonies over the last 38,000 years reveals a sudden change from a fish-based diet to krill that began around 200 years ago. This is most likely due to the decline of the Antarctic fur seal since the late 18th century and baleen whales during the early 20th century. The reduction of competition from these predators has resulted in a surplus of krill, which the penguins now exploit as an easier source of food. Jellyfish including species in the genera Chrysaora and Cyanea were found to be actively sought-out food items, while they previously had been thought to be only accidentally ingested. Similar preferences were found in the little penguin, yellow-eyed penguin and Magellanic penguin. Breeding An egg in the MHNT Mating in Antarctica Stuffed chick at Auckland Museum Adélie penguins breed from October to February on shores around the Antarctic continent. Adélies build rough nests of stones. Two eggs are laid; these are incubated for 32 to 34 days by the parents taking turns (shifts typically last for 12 days). The chicks remain in the nest for 22 days before joining crèches. The chicks moult into their juvenile plumage and go out to sea after 50 to 60 days. Adélie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in late October or November, after completing a migration that takes them away from the Antarctic continent for the dark, cold winter months. Their nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about -2 °C/-19\\xa0°C or -2.2\\xa0°F), the parents take turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent that is incubating does not eat and doesn\\'t even leave to defecate but instead projects feces away from the nest. In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Adélie penguin lives on sea ice, but needs the ice-free land to breed. With a reduction in sea ice, populations of the Adélie penguin have dropped by 65% over the past 25 years in the Antarctic Peninsula. Young Adélie penguins which have no experience in social interaction may react to false cues when the penguins gather to breed. They may, for instance, attempt to mate with other males, with young chicks or with dead females. Levick was the first to record such behavior (1911–12), but his notes were deemed too indecent for publication at the time; they were rediscovered and published in 2012. \"The pamphlet, declined for publication with the official Scott expedition reports, commented on the frequency of sexual activity, auto-erotic behaviour and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females, including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks and homosexual behaviour,\" states the analysis written by Douglas Russell and colleagues William Sladen and David Ainley. \"His observations were, however, accurate, valid and, with the benefit of hindsight, deserving of publication.\" Levick observed the Adélie penguins at Cape Adare, the site of the largest Adélie penguin rookery in the world. , he has been the only one to study this particular colony and he observed it for an entire breeding cycle. The discovery significantly illuminates the behaviour of the species whose population some researchers believe to be a bellwether of climate change. Migration Adélie penguins are identified and weighed each time they cross the automated weighbridge on their way to or from the sea. Adélie penguins living in the Ross Sea region in Antarctica migrate an average of about 13000 km each year as they follow the sun from their breeding colonies to winter foraging grounds and back again. During the winter, the sun does not rise south of the Antarctic Circle, but sea ice grows during the winter months and increases for hundreds of miles from the shoreline, and into more northern latitudes, all around Antarctica. As long as the penguins live at the edge of the fast ice, they will see sunlight. As the ice recedes in the spring, the penguins remain on the edge of it, until once again, they are on the shoreline during a sunnier season. The longest treks have been recorded at 17600 km. Osmoregulation Adélie penguins are faced with extreme osmotic conditions, as their frozen habitats offer little fresh water. Such desert conditions mean that the vast majority of the available water is highly saline, causing the diets of Adélie penguins to be heavy in salt. They manage to circumvent this problem by eating krill with internal concentrations of salt at the lower end of their possible concentrations, helping to lower the amount of ingested salts. The amount of sodium imposed by this sort of diet is still relatively heavy and can create complications when considering the less tolerant chicks. Adult Adélie penguins feed their chicks by regurgitating the predigested krill, which can impose an excessive salt intake on the chicks. Adult birds address this problem by altering the ion concentrations while the food is still being held in their stomachs. By removing a portion of the sodium and potassium ions, adult Adélie penguins protect their chicks from ingesting excessive amounts of sodium. Adélie penguins also manage their salt intake by concentrating cloacal fluids to a much higher degree than most other birds are capable. This ability is present regardless of ontogeny in Adélie penguins, meaning that both adults and juveniles are capable of withstanding extreme levels of salt ion concentration. However, chicks do possess a greater ability to concentrate chloride ions in their cloacal fluids. Salt glands also play a major role in the excretion of excess salts. In aquatic birds such as the Adelie penguin, nasal salt glands excrete an extremely concentrated sodium chloride solution, reducing the load on their kidneys. These excretions are crucial in the maintenance of Antarctic ecosystems. Penguin rookeries can be home to thousands of penguins, all of which are concentrating waste products in their digestive tracts and nasal glands. These excretions inevitably drop to the ground. The concentration of salts and nitrogenous wastes helps to facilitate the flow of material from the sea to the land, serving to make it habitable for bacteria which live in the soils. In Antarctica Threats Adult Adélie penguins are regularly preyed upon by leopard seals. South polar skuas, in particular and Giant petrels kill many chicks and eat eggs as well. Giant petrels and orcas will occasionally kill adult Adelie penguins. Kelp gulls and snowy sheathbills also prey on chicks and eggs.'},\n",

       "    {'description': 'The Adélie penguin is a mid-sized bird, measuring 70 – in length and weighing 3.8 to. Although the sexes look the same, females have shorter wings and beaks, and weigh significantly less. The adult is black on the head, throat and upperparts, with snowy white underparts. It has a conspicuous white around a black iris. The beak is largely covered with black feathers, leaving only the tip exposed; this is primarily black, though it can show indistinct reddish-brown markings. The upper surface of the wing is black with a white trailing edge, while the underside is white with a narrow black leading edge and a small black tip. The legs and feet, which are mostly unfeathered, are pinkish. Upon hatching, the chick is fully covered in down feathers. This coat of feathers is typically silvery-grey (darker on the head), though some birds are much darker overall. Within 10\\xa0days, the chick moults into another set of down feathers, this time all dark smoky-grey. Once they have moulted a third time, 7–9\\xa0weeks after hatching, the immature birds are similar to adults in appearance, though they tend to be smaller with a bluer tinge to their upperparts and white (rather than black) chins and throats. They lack the full white eye ring of the adult until they are at least a year old. Similar species The adult Adélie penguin is unlikely to be confused with any other species, but the white-throated immature bird can resemble the chinstrap penguin. However, the black on its face extends below its eyes, and it lacks a black line under the throat (the \"chinstrap\") that the chinstrap penguin has. In addition, the bill of the chinstrap penguin is longer, and lacks the feathering that covers most of the bill of the Adélie penguin.'},\n",
       "    {'description': \"The Adélie penguin is a truly Antarctic creature – one of only four penguin species to nest on the continent itself. Breeding colonies are scattered along Antarctica's coasts and on a number of sub-Antarctic islands, including those in the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, the South Sandwich Islands, the Balleny Islands, Scott Island and South Georgia. The penguins are much less common north of the 60th parallel south, but have occurred as vagrants in Australia, New Zealand and southern South America. During the breeding season, they need bare, rocky ground on which to build their nests. They will not nest on ice, and preferentially choose areas where wind or the angle of the sun (or both) helps to keep snow drifts from accumulating. At the start of the breeding seasons, colony sites may be up to 100 km from open water, though the distance decreases as summer progresses and the pack ice breaks up. Once they have finished breeding, adult Adélie penguins typically move to ice floes or ice shelves to moult, though some remain onshore. During the winter, the birds remain in the pack ice zone, with most moving north to reach areas where there is visible light for at least part of the day – thus north of roughly 73°S. While some remain near their breeding colonies, others may move hundreds or thousands of kilometres away. As long as there are breaks in the pack ice, they can survive hundreds of kilometres south of open water, and birds are known to forage in winter in areas with up to 80% pack ice cover.\"},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Because of its very large and increasing population (estimated at more than 10\\xa0million mature individuals in 2020), and its unfragmented habitat, the Adélie penguin is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a species of least concern. A comprehensive census of the global Adélie penguin population was carried out in 2014 using analysis of high-resolution satellite images in combination with actual field surveys. The researchers looked for guano-discoloured coastal areas (red/brown patches in areas with no snow) in the satellite images, and augmented their findings with field surveys in areas where no good satellite images were available or where the presence of multiple penguins species was suspected. The results of field surveys were only used if they had been done within the previous four years. This census found an estimated 3.79 million breeding pairs in 251 distinct breeding colonies, including more than 40 that had never been surveyed before, a 53% increase over a census completed 20 years earlier. The colonies are distributed around the coastline of the Antarctic land and ocean. Colonies have declined on the Antarctic Peninsula since the early 1980s, but those declines have been more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. During the breeding season, they congregate in large breeding colonies, some over a quarter of a million pairs. Individual colonies can vary dramatically in size, and some may be particularly vulnerable to climate fluctuations. The Danger Islands have been identified as an \"important bird area\" by BirdLife International largely because it supports Adélie penguin colonies, with 751,527 pairs recorded in at least five distinct colonies. In March 2018, a colony of 1.5 million was discovered.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'The first Adélie penguin specimens were collected by crew members of French explorer Jules Dumont d\\'Urville on his expedition to Antarctica in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Jacques Bernard Hombron and Honoré Jacquinot, two French surgeons who doubled as naturalists on the journey, described the bird for science in 1841, giving it the scientific name Catarrhactes adeliæ. They used specimens collected from an area of the continent which had been named \"terre Adélie\", French for Adélie Land, itself named for Dumont d\\'Urville\\'s wife, Adèle. The bird was later placed in several other genera, including Eudyptes, Pygoscelis and the now-defunct genus Dasyrhamphus, and was also later inadvertently redescribed as Pygoscelis brevirostris. The Adélie penguin is one of three species now assigned to the genus Pygoscelis. DNA evidence suggests the Pygoscelis lineage diverged from that of other penguin species some 38\\xa0million years ago, roughly 2\\xa0million years after the ancestors of the genus Aptenodytes diverged. Adélie penguins evolved about 19\\xa0million years ago, branching from the ancestor of the other two members of the genus (chinstrap and gentoo penguins), both of which evolved some 5\\xa0million years later. Although it has no identifiable subspecies, the Adélie penguin has two distinct genetic lineages: one found primarily in the Ross Sea, and the other widespread throughout the Antarctic. The genus name Pygoscelis is a compound word, composed of the Ancient Greek words pugē, meaning \"rump\", and skelos, meaning \"leg\". The members of this genus are often called \"brush-tailed penguins\", a reference to their long, stiff tail feathers. The birds regularly use their tails for support, and the stiff feathers sweep the ground as the penguins walk. The specific name adeliae indicates the location from which the type specimen was collected.'}],\n",

Recentsatellite tracking of Leopard Seals suggests that they move north as sea ice forms and expands in autumn and winter and then move south again toward the Antarctic continent as sea ice melts and recedes in spring and summer. Small numbers of Leopard Seals have been regularly recorded as transients from coasts of New Zealand, Tasmania, Australia, South America, and South Africa. Seasonally resident and vagrant seals have also been regularly observed on many subantarctic islands including Marion Island, Kerguelen Island, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, South Georgia, South Orkney Islands, Falkland Islands (= Malvinas), Juan Fernandez Islands, and Easter Island. The most northerly records reported for Leopard Seals have been in the western South Pacific Ocean at the Cook Islands ofsingle juveniles in June 1956 and July 1960, the eastern South Pacific Ocean on Easter Island and Chilean coast at Punto Choros, and the western South Atlantic Ocean at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. An extremely isolated sighting of a ten-month-old Leopard Seal in the central South Pacific Ocean in August 2013 corresponded with a new record for annual coverage of winter sea ice in the Southern Ocean.'},\n",

Little is known about the Leopard Seal’s breeding system, but most observations of newborns have been in November and early December in pack-ice habitats, with weaning c. 3 — 4 weeks later. Mating is thought to take place in the water after offspring are weaned and females resume feeding. Male Leopard Seals become sexually mature at c. 3 - 6 years old and females at 2 - 7 years old. Longevity is estimated to be more than 26 years.'},\n",

Leopard Seals are protected from harvesting by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. Leopard Seals are widespread and, similar to the other Antarctic seals that inhabit pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore infrequently undertaken.

       "    {'description': 'Food and Feeding. Leopard Seals have a very diverse diet that changes with seasonal and local abundance of prey. Most prey is caught in the water. Leopard Seals feed on fish, cephalopods, krill, and even warm-blooded prey such as Subantarctic Fur Seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis), Antarctic Fur Seals (Arctocephalus gazella), Australian Sea Lions (Neophoca cinerea), New Zealand Sea Lion (Phocarctos hookeri), Crabeater Seals (Lobodon carcinophaga), Ross Seals (Ommatophoca rossii), and Southern Elephant Seal (Mirounga leonina), with a focus on young Crabeater Seals and Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddellit). Leopard Seals are known to prey on penguins (Spheniscidae).

The presence of antifreeze glycroproteins allows the Antarctic toothfish (and other notothenioids) to thrive in subzero waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. The Antarctic toothfish's voracious appetite also is important in coping with cold water.Roberts, J.; Xavier, J.C.; and Agnew, D.L. (2011).

Being large, and consistent with the unstructured food webs of the ocean (i.e., big fish eat little fish regardless of identity, even eating their own offspring), the Antarctic toothfish has been characterized as a voracious predator. Furthermore, by being by far the largest midwater fish in the Southern Ocean, it is thought to fill the ecological role that sharks play in other oceans.Andriashev, A.P. (1962).

CCAMLR Document WG-FSA-98/49, Hobart, Australia. Aiding in that role, the Antarctic toothfish is one of only five notothenioid species that, as adults, are neutrally buoyant. This buoyancy is attained at 100–120\\xa0cm in length and enables them to spend time above the bottom without expending extra energy.Yukhov, V.L. (1971).

Coloring is black to olive brown, sometimes lighter on the undersides, with a mottled pattern on body and fins. Small fish blend in very well among the benthic sponges and corals. The species has a broad head, an elongated body, long dorsal and anal fins, large pectoral fins, and a rudder-like caudal fin.

However, notothenioid fishes are not closely related to cods, which are in another taxonomic order, the Gadiformes. The generic name Dissostichus is from the Greek (twofold) and stichus (line) and refers to the presence of two long lateral lines, which are very important to the species’ ecology. The common name \"toothfish\" refers to the presence of biserial dentition in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance. The habitat of the Antarctic toothfish is in subzero degree water below latitude 60°S. This species and the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eliginoides) are sometimes marketed for food as Chilean sea bass.'},\n",

Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where Antarctic toothfish occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. Antarctic toothfish also have a very well developed sense of smell, which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.'},\n",

The existence of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most Antarctic toothfish are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this is the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original stock size, fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds are presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of Antarctic toothfish pass. Typically, the fishing season has finished in the area by the end of February and for the remainder of the year, much of the area is covered by sea ice, providing a natural impediment to fishing.Fenaughty and Parker (2014) Quantifying the impacts of ice on demersal longlining; a case study in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 . WG-FSA 14/55 rev 2 This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic longline fishing. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14.Fishery Report 2014: Exploratory fishery for Dissostichus spp. in Subareas 88.1 and 88.2. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/08%20TOT881%20882%202014_1.pdf The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR. CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each year of assessment), with the additional condition that the probability is less than a 10% that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period. Current spawning stock biomass for Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71–78%), well above the 50% target reference point. An independent study was reported to have detected the disappearance of large fish at the southern periphery of its range in the McMurdo Sound and was postulated to be consistent with this apparent loss of large fish.Ainley, D.G.; Nur, N.; Eastman, J.T.; Ballard, G.; Parkinson, C.L.; Evans, C.W.; and DeVries, A.L. (2012). Decadal trends in abundance, size and condition of Antarctic toothfish in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972-2011. Fish & Fisheries, .

One adult female type-C killer whale has been seen in both New Zealand waters and McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and a high large proportion of type-C killer whales sighted in McMurdo Sound have scars caused by cookiecutter sharks that are currently assumed to be limited to north of 50°S. At the same time as this study was occurring, Italian whale experts at Terra Nova Bay, about 360\\xa0km north of Scott Base, deployed satellite transmitters on type-C killer whales to determine the whales' movements. Their results independently verified that type-C killer whales were commuting between Scott Base and the waters off Northland. The total catch of Antarctic toothfish in 2013–14 was 3820 tonnes; 3,320 tonnes of this were taken from the Ross Sea (FAO Statistical Divisions 88.1 and 88.2), with the remainder taken from other high seas areas within the CCAMLR convention area.Table 1, page 336 Report of the Thirty-Third Meeting of the Scientific Committee Hobart, Australia 20–24 October 2014. https://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/e-sc-xxxiii_1.pdf\"},\n",

       "    {'description': 'The ecosystem approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention. The ecosystem approach uses decision rules based on both population status targets and limit reference points, and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem status in the calculation of these targets. Different reference points to account for the needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions,Conservation Measure 41-09 (2014) Limits on the exploratory fishery for Dissostichus spp. in Statistical Subarea 88.1 in the 2014/15 season. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-09-2014, Conservation Measure 41-10 (2014) Limits on the exploratory fishery for Dissostichus spp. in Statistical Subarea 88.2 in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons. http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-41-10-2014 and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds, and vulnerable marine ecosystems. Annually reviewed mitigation measures such as line weighting and streamer lines minimize seabird bycatch, which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area.Conservation Measure 24-02 (2014) Longline weighting for seabird conservation http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-24-02-2014 The 50% (target) and 20% (limit) reference points used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and limit reference points set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30–35% of their pre-exploitation abundances.Hilborn, R. 2010. Pretty good yield and exploited fishes. Marine Policy, 34, 193–196 CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted. This is required by Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the stock size will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that no feedback occurs during each assessment. The catch limit, though, is recalculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennial assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves. Environment and bycatch CCAMLR imposes stringent environmental protection and bycatch mitigation measures to Antarctic toothfish fisheries, including: Monitoring of daytime setting and movement of vessels from the fishery should any vessel catch more than three seabirdsCCAMLR CM 25-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-25-02-2009 Use of streamer lines during setting to keep birds away from baited hooks Weighting of lines to ensure fast sink rates to prevent seabirds from accessing baited hooks CCAMLR CM 24-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-24-02-2008, and CCAMLR CM 25-02, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-25-02-2009 The use of bird exclusion devices to prevent birds from accessing hooks whilst lines are being hauled Limitations on the release of fish offal overboard at the same time as setting and hauling of lines to avoid attracting seabirds: An additional requirement prohibits the dumping of all offal south of 60°S, the region where Antarctic toothfish are caughtCCAMLR CM 26-01, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/measure-26-01-2001 Prohibition on the dumping of oil, plastic, garbage, food waste, poultry, eggs or eggshells, sewage, and ash by fishing vessels Prohibition of the use of plastic packaging bands on fishing vessels Incidental mortality of seabirds as a result of fishing has fallen to near-zero levels in the CCAMLR convention area. No mortality of seabirds or marine mammals was recorded as a result of fishing for Antarctic toothfish in 2011–12 and only two seabirds (southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus) have been killed as a result of fishing in the Ross Sea since 1996/97. Compliance Compliance measures adopted by CCAMLR apply to all Antarctic toothfish fisheries. These include: At-sea inspections of fishing vesselsCCAMLR System of Inspection Vessel licensing Port inspections of fishing vessels Continuous reporting of fishing vessel positions via satellite-linked vessel monitoring systems Catch documentation scheme for toothfish, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing through to the final point of sale and requires verification and authorisation by government authorities at each step The requirement to carry two scientific observers on each licensed vessel – including one from a member state other than the vessel flag Sustainability In November 2010, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery as a sustainable and well-managed fishery. The certification is contentious, with many conservation groups protesting the certification due to the paucity of information needed to reliably manage the fishery, and that only eight of the 19 vessels in the fishery during the latest year for which data are publicly available were certified. During the 2013–14 season, vessels operating under the Marine Stewardship Certification landed 51.3% of all Antarctic toothfish from the Ross Sea Region (CCAMLR Subarea 88.1) and 64.7% of Antarctic toothfish from the Amundsen Sea sector (CCAMLR Subarea 88.2). The argument that only a portion of Antarctic toothfish is certified, the high price it commands, and the remote areas where a large proportion of the fish are caught have been advanced as an encouragement to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and mislabeling. A 2011 genetic study of MSC-labeled Antarctic toothfish found in markets revealed a significant proportion was not from the MSC-certified stock, and many were not toothfish at all. The MSC had conducted its own internal study, which found no evidence of mislabeling. The MSC conducts an annual audit of the fishery which includes sampling of certified product. Due to the challenges that faced toothfish management in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., IUU fishing, mislabeling, and inadequate data for management), consumer seafood guides such as Seafood Watch placed toothfish of both species (Chilean seabass) on their red, or “avoid”, list;Seafood Watch (2012) however, in light of up-to-date, internationally peer-reviewed scientific information, in April 2013, Seafood Watch upgraded the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery to a \"good alternative\". Following a comprehensive review in 2012, the Monterey Bay Aquarium revised its rating of Antarctic toothfish to \\'good alternative\\'. Greenpeace International added the Antarctic toothfish to its seafood red list in 2010. This assessment is contentious. Greenpeace International Seafood Red list This approach is at variance with the high score given the fishery when it was granted certification by the MSC.'},\n",

       "   'descriptions': [{'description': \"The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl, is a large, white, owl of the true owl family. Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra. It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls. One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with largely white plumage. Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to more have more extensive flecks of dark brown.Holt, D. W., M. D. Larson, N. Smith, D. L. Evans, and D. F. Parmelee (2020). Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus), version 1.0. In Birds of the World (S. M. Billerman, Editor). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls. Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime. The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding efforts and entirely global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling lemmings but in the non-breeding season and occasionally during breeding the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available prey, most often other small mammals and northerly water birds (as well as, opportunistically, carrion). Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra.Hume, R. (1991). Owls of the world. Running Press, Philadelphia. The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered. Despite the short Arctic summer, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn. The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable. A largely migratory bird, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably irrupting to the south in large numbers. Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in depth knowledge historically about the snowy owl's status. However, recent data suggests the species is declining precipitously.Bent, A. C. (1938). Life Histories of North American Birds of Prey (part 2), Orders Falconiformes and Stringiformes (Vol. 170). US Government Printing Office. Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals, recent data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less. While the causes are not well-understood, numerous, complex environment factors often correlated with global warming are probably at the forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl's existence.\"},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Juvenile owls do not mind associating with one another, especially during winter. Snowy owls may be active to some extent at both day, from dawn to dusk, and night. Snowy owls have been seen to be active even during the very brief winter daytime in the northern winter. During the Arctic summer, snowy owls may tend to peak in activity during the twilight that is the darkest time available given the lack of full nightfall. Reportedly, the peak time of activity during summer is between 9:00\\xa0pm and 3:00\\xa0am in Norway.Hagen, Y. (1960). The Snowy Owl on Hardangervidda in the Summer of 1959. Papers of The Norwegian State Game Research. 2, No. 7. The peak time of activity for those owls that once nested on Fetlar was reported between 10:00 and 11:00\\xa0pm. According to one authority, the least active times are at noon and midnight. As days become longer near autumn in Utqiaġvik, the snowy owls in the tundra become more active around nightfall and can often be seen resting during the day, especially if it is raining. During winter in Alberta, snowy owls were tracked in the daytime, despite being also active at night (as they were deemed too difficult to track). In the study, they were most active during 8:00–10:00\\xa0am and 4:00–6:00\\xa0pm and often rested mostly from 10:00\\xa0am to 4:00\\xa0pm. The owls were perched for 98% of observed daylight and seemed to time their activity to peak times for rodents. The variation of activity is probably in correspondence with their primary prey, the lemmings, and like them, the snowy owl may be considered cathermal. This species can withstand extremely cold temperatures, having been recorded in temperatures as low as minus 62.5 degrees Celsius with no obvious discomfort and also withstood a 5-hour exposure to minus 93 degrees Celsius but may have struggled with oxygen consumption by the end of this period. The snowy owl has perhaps the second lowest thermal conduction to the plumage on average of any bird after only the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and rivals the best insulated mammals, such as Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) and Arctic fox, as the best insulated polar creature. Presumably as many as 7 rodents would need to be eaten daily to survive an extremely cold winter\\'s day. Adults and young both have been seen to shelter behind rocks to shield themselves from particularly harsh winds or storms. Snowy owls often spending a majority of time on the ground, perched mostly on a slight rise of elevation. It has been interpreted from the morphology of their skeletal structure (i.e. their short, broad legs) that snowy owls are not well-suited to perching extensively in trees or rocks and prefer a flat surface to sit upon. However, they may perch more so in winter though do so only mainly when hunting, at times on hummocks, Fenceposts, telegraph poles by roads, radio and transmission towers, Haystacks, chimneys and the roofs of houses and large buildings. Rocks may be used as perches at times in all seasons. Though often relatively sluggish owls, like most related species, they are capable of sudden dashing movements in various contexts. Snowy owls can walk and run quite quickly, using outstretched wings for balance if necessary. This owl flies with fairly rowing wingbeats, occasionally interrupted by gliding on stretched wings. The flight is fairly buoyant for a Bubo owl. When displaying, the male may engage in an undulating flight with interspersed wingbeats and gliding in a slight dihedral, finally dropping rather vertically to the ground. They are capable for swimming but do not usually do so. Some seen to be swimming were previously injured but young have been seen to swim into water to escape predators if they cannot fly yet. They will also drink when unfrozen water is available. Snowy owl mothers have been observed to preen their young in the wild, while pairs in captivity have been observed to allopreen. In the period leading up to breeding, snowy owls switched regularly between searching (for nesting grounds) and loafing, often searching less when snow cover was less extensive.Therrien, J. F., Pinaud, D., Gauthier, G., Lecomte, N., Bildstein, K. L., & Bety, J. (2015). Pre-breeding prospecting behaviour of snowy owls (data from Therrien et al. 2015). Snowy owls are often somewhat ponderous in movements but can be surprisingly and suddenly fast on the wing. Snowy owls will fight with conspecifics in all seasons occasionally but this is relatively infrequent during breeding and rarer still during winter. Dogfights and talon interlocking may ensue if the fight between two snowy owls continues to escalate. A study determined that snowy owls are able to orient the whitest parts of their plumage towards the sun, spending about 44% of time oriented as such during sunny days and much less on cloudy days. Some authors interpret this as a presumed signal to conspecifics, but thermoregulation could also be a factor. It is known that during winter in Alberta that female snowy owls are territorial towards one another and may not leave an area for up to 80 days but males are nomadic, usually only staying 1–2 days in an area (seldom to 3–17 days). The females spent on average seven times as long in a given area than did males. During threat displays, individuals will lower the front of the body, stretch the head low and forward, with partially extended wings and feathers on the head and raise their back. If continuously threatened or cornered, the posture in the threat display may become still more contoured and, if pressed, the owl will like back and attempt to slash with its large talons. The threat displays of males are generally more emphatic than those of females.Kaufman, K. (1996). Lives of North American Birds. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston & New York. Although snowy owls have been considered as semi-colonial, they do not appear to fit this mold well. Nesting sites can be loosely clustered but this is a coincidental response to concentrated prey and each pair tends to be somewhat intolerant of each other. During winter, snowy owls are usually solitary but some aggregations have been recorded, especially nearer the Arctic when more narrow food selection can lead to up to 20–30 owls gathering in an area of about 20 to. Congregations were also recorded in the winter in Montana, where 31–35 owls wintered in a 2.6 km2 area, owls mostly grouped in loose aggregations of 5–10 owls each or occasionally side-by-side or about 20 m apart. In extreme cases in Utqiaġvik, the owls may have exceptionally close active nests that may be down to only 800 to apart. Juvenile males appear to be especially prone to loose associations with one another, appearing to be non-territorial and able to hunt freely in front of one another. In a 213 km2 area in and around Utqiaġvik, productive years may have about 54 nests while none may be found in poor years. Utqiaġvik may have about 5 owls in early summer every 1.6 km, have a nest spacing of 1.6 to and the owls territory size is about 5.2 to. In Churchill, Manitoba, nest spacing averaged about 3.2 km. In Southampton Island in a year when the owls nested there, nest spacing averaged 3.5 km, with the closest two 1 km apart and density per nest was 22 km2. In Nunavut, densities could go from 1 owl per 2.6 km2 in a productive year to 1 owl per 26 km2 in a poor year and from 36 nests in a 100 km2 area to none at all.Manning, T. H., Höhn, E. O. & MacPherson, A. H. (1956). The birds of Banks Island. National Museum of Canada Bulletin 143, Biological Series 48.Vaughn, R. (1992). In search of Arctic birds. London: T & AD Poyser, Ltd. Owl density on Wrangel Island in Russia was observed be a single bird each 0.11 to.Menyushina, I. E. (1997). \"Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca) reproduction in relation to lemming population cycles on Wrangel Island\". In: Biology and conservation of owls of the Northern Hemisphere: 2nd International Symposium, J. R. Duncan, D. H. Johnson and T. H. Nicholls (eds.), pp. 572–582. St. Paul: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service, North Central Forest Experiment Station. The first known study of winter territories took place in Horicon Marsh where owls ranged from 0.5 to each. In Calgary, Alberta, mean territory size of juvenile females in winter was 407.5 ha and adult females was 195.2 ha. Wintering owls in central Saskatchewan were radio-monitored, determining that 11 males had an average range of 54.4 km2, while that of 12 females was 31.9 km2 with the combined average being 53.8 km2. Snowy owls are usually awake, aware and not infrequently active during daytime. Migration It is fair to say that the snowy owl is a partial, if fairly irregular, migrant, having a very broad but patchy wintering range. 1st year birds tend to disperse farther south in winter than older owls with males wintering usually somewhat more to the south than females of equivalent ages, adult females often wintering the farthest north. The snowy owl likely covers more ground than almost any other owl in movements but many complex individual variations are known in movements, and they often do not take the traditional north–south direction that might be assumed. Migratory movements appear to be somewhat more common in America than in Asia. A study of wintering owls in the Kola Peninsula determined that the mean date of arrival of owls was 10 November with a departure date of 13 April, covering an average of 991 km during the course of the wintering period and clustering where prey was more concentrated.Øien, I. J., Aarvak, T., Jacobsen, K. O., & Solheim, R. (2018). \"Satellite Telemetry Uncovers Important Wintering Areas for Snowy Owls On the Kola Peninsula, Northwestern Russia\". Орнитология, 42, 42–49. Some variety of movements recorded each autumn and snowy owls winter annually in plains of Siberia and Mongolia and prairies and marshlands of Canada. The Great Plains area of southern Canada host wintering snowy owls about 2 to 10 times more frequently than other areas of the continent. Some weak correlation has made with individuals having some level of fealty to certain wintering sites. Wintering snowy owls, a total of 419, recorded in Duluth, Minnesota from 1974 to 2012 would occur in larger numbers in years where rats were more plentiful. The amount of individual returns among 43 Duluth-wintering owls was fairly low in subsequent winters (8 for 1 year, a small handful in the next few years, and 9 in non-consecutive years). Sometimes surveys appeared to reveal hundreds of wintering snowy owls on coastal sea ice during an irruptive year. Three siblings that hatched in same nest in Cambridge Bay were recovered in drastically different spots at least a year later: one in eastern Ontario, one in Hudson Bay and one in Sakhalin Island. A nestling banded in Hordaland was recovered 1380 km to the northeast in Finnmark. In the Logan Airport, 17 of 452 owls were recorded to return, eleven the following year, three 2 years later, and then singles variously 6, 10 and 16 years later. A banded female from Utqiaġvik was recorded to migrate over 1928 km along seacoast down to Russia, returning over 1528 km and covering at least 3476 km in total. Another banded young female from Utqiaġvik went to the same Russian areas, returned to Utqiaġvik and then onto Victoria Island, but did appear to breed, while another also covered a similar route but ended up nesting on Banks Island. Another female migrated to the Canada–United States border, then moved back to the Gulf of Alaska, then to winter in the same border areas and then finally to both Banks and Victoria Island. Snowy owls from the Canadian Arctic were monitored to have covered an average of 1100 km in one autumn then covered an average of 2900 km a year later. In late winter, owls from the same area were found to have covered a mean of 4093 km of ground in the tundra and spent a mean of 108 days, apparently searching for a suitable nesting situation the entire time. In no fewer than 24 winters between 1882 and 1988, large numbers have occurred in Canada and the United States. These were irruption years. Record breeding irruptive years were recorded in the winters of 2011–2012 and 2014–2015. In the 1940s, it was calculated that the mean gape in time between large irruptions was 3.9 years. Southbound movements as such are much more conspicuous after peak vole years, once thought to be separated by periods of around 3–7 years. However, more extensive research has weakened the argument that irruptions are entirely food-based and the data indicates that irruptive movements are far from predictable. This is because a statewide survey in Alaska found no statewide synchrony in lemming numbers. Therefore, rather than decline of lemmings, it is the successful productivity of several pairs that plays the role, resulting in a large number of young owls that then irrupt. However, the snowy owls cannot breed in high numbers unless lemmings are widely available on the tundra.Pitelka, F. A. & Batzli, G. O. (1993). \"Distribution, abundance, and habitat use by lemmings on the north slope of Alaska\". In: The biology of lemmings, N. C. Stenseth and R. A. Ims (eds.), pp. 213–236. London: Academic Press.Krebs, C. J. (1993). \"Are lemmings large Microtus or small reindeer? A review of lemming cycles after 25 years and future recommendations for future work\". In: The biology of lemmings, N. C. Stenseth and R. Ims (eds.), pp. 247–260. London: Academic Press for the Linnean Society of London. This connection of irruptions to high years of productivity was confirmed in a study by Robillard et al. (2016). About 90% of the snowy owls seen in irruptive years from 1991 to 2016 that were ageable were identified as juveniles.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Pair bond and breeding territory In Utqiaġvik, of 239 recorded breeding attempts, 232 were monogamous, the other 7 social bigamy. On Baffin Island, 1 male bred with 2 females and sired 11 total fledged young. Another case of bigamy was reported in Norway where the 2 females bred to one male were 1.3 km apart in nest site location. On Feltar from 1967 to 1975, a male breed with two females, 1 younger and was possibly his own daughter. In the Feltar males first time breeding with both females, he did not bring food to the younger female. However, when older female disappeared the following year, the male and younger female producing 4 young, but disappeared the subsequent year altogether in 1975. There are also unconfirmed cases of polyandry, with 1 female being fed by 2 males. Snowy owls can breed once per year but when food is scarce many do not even attempt to breed. Despite frequent wandering in search of food, they generally adhere more so than to a strict breeding season than short-eared owls nesting in the tundra. 9 radio-tagged female snowy owls about Bylot Island were tracked to study how pre-laying snow cover effects their searching behavior for breeding area. These tracked females searched an average of 36 days and covered an average of 1251 km. It is thought that the male and female mutually find an attractive breeding spot independently and converge. The breeding territory normally averages about 2.6 km2 as in both Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island but varies in accordance to abundance of food and density of owls. Nesting territories average at Baffin island in the range of 8 to during poor lemming years. Nesting territories may up to 22 km2 on Southampton Island and had a mean distance of 4.5 km between active nests. In Utqiaġvik, nesting pairs can vary from none to at least 7 and the territories average 5 to, with mean nest distances of 1.5 to. In the Norwegian highlands, nesting occurs only at times of plenty distances of 1.2 to between nests, averaging 2.1 km. Males marks territory with singing and display flights and likely always initiates. During the display, he engages in exaggerated wing beats with a shallow undulating and bouncy courtship flight with wings held in a dihedral. He often drops to the ground but then flies again to only glide gently back down. Overall, the flight is somewhat reminiscent of the flight of a moth. Females will answer her mate with her song during courtship. While courting, the male often also carries a lemming in his bill, then bows with cocked tail, similarly as in related owls (seldom displaying some other prey like snow buntings). He then flaps his wings open in an emphatic manner, with the ground display being relatively brief (about 5 minutes). The female may possibly refuse to breed if ritual not performed. A possible courtship was engaged in by a male in southern Saskatchewan when a female was sighted. On Southampton Island, at least 20 males observed in late May in a \"lemming year\". Nesting territory defense displays, not highly different from courtship displays, includes undulating flight and stiffly raised wings with bouts of exaggerated, delayed wing beats, looking like enormous white moths exposing their white wings under the sun. At times, competing males will interlock claws in mid-air. Territorial and nuptial displays are followed by a ground display by the male with the wings arched up in an \"angel\" posture, visible for well over a mile. Nest sites Snowy owls often seek out polygons such as these in the tundra. Most individuals arrive at the nest site by April or May with a few overwintering arctic exceptions. Males advertises potential nest sites to his mate by scratching the ground and spreading his wings over it. The nest is usually a shallow depression on a windswept eminence in the open tundra. There seems to be a variety of qualifiers for appropriate nest sites. The nest site is typically snow-free and dry relative to the surrounding environment, usually with a good view of the surrounding landscape. The nest may be made of ridges, elevated mounds, high polygons, hummocks, hills, man-made mounds and occasionally rocky outcrops. If covered with vegetation, taller plants that may obstruct view are plucked away sometimes. The nest sites are often long-established and naturally created by the freeze-thaw process of the tundra. Gravel bars may be used as well. The female may take the most active role in the nest\\'s condition of any owl species. No owl build their own nests but female snowy owls take about three days constructing a scrape, digging with her claws and rotating until a fairly circular bowl is formed. She will still not construct or add foreign materials to the nest (despite some circumstantial evidence of moss and grass from outside the nest mound being found). In two separate cases in Utqiaġvik, two separate females dug out a second scrape to the side and below the main nests and appeared to have called all chicks to the more secluded nest to ride out severe weather until the skies cleared. The Utqiaġvik nest scrapes averaged 47.7 x in 91 with a mean depth of 9.8 cm while the scrapes were smaller in Hooper Bay, reportedly 25 to diameter and 4 to in depth. Occasionally, in the lower tundra, snowy owls may too use old nests of rough-legged buzzards as well as abandoned eagle nests. Unlike other northerly breeding raptorial birds, the snowy owl is not known to nest on cliffs and the like, so do not enter into direct competition with eagles, falcons, ravens or other Bubo owls when nesting to the relative south. The area of nest mound often has a relatively rich plant life which attract the lemmings, which may tunnel right under and around the owl\\'s nest. Geese, ducks and shorebirds of several species known to gain incidental protection by nesting close to snowy owls. Conversely, the snowy owls will sometimes kill and eat both young and adults of these birds, which implies a trade-off in the benefits.Smith, P. A. (2003). Factors affecting nest site selection and reproductive success of tundra nesting shorebirds (Doctoral dissertation, University of British Columbia). Eggs An illustration of 8 European owl species\\' eggs, with the snowy owl in the middle of the right row. Note the much larger egg of the Eurasian eagle-owl at bottom. Egg-laying normally begins during early May to the first 10 days of June. Late thaws are harmful to them since they allow too little time for the full breeding process, with particularly importance given to good food supply in May for adults, even more so apparently than food supply in July when young are being fed. Late nests are possible cases of inexperienced pairs, low food supplies, bigamy or even replacement clutches. The clutch is extremely variable in size averaging around 7–9, with up to 15 or 16 eggs recorded in extreme cases. The clutch size very large relative to related species. Mean clutch sizes were 7.5 in a sample of 24 in Hooper Bay (range of 5–11); 6.7 in a sample of seven from Utqiaġvik (4–9); 9 in a sample of a sample of 5 in Baffin Island; 9.8 on Victoria Island; 8.4 (in a sample of 14) on Elsemere Island; 7.4 on Wrangel Island and 7.74 in Finnish Lapland. The average clutch size was 9.8 in a good year in Victoria Island while in a good year in Utqiaġvik the mean was 6.5. The clutch is laid directly to the ground and are pure, glossy white. An average egg is around 56.4 x with a range of heights from 50 to and diameter of 41 to. Egg weights are around 47.5 to, the median or average being 53 and in different datasets.Baicich, P.J. & Harrison, C.J.O. (1997). A Guide to the Nests, Eggs, and Nestlings of North American Birds. Academic Press, San Diego, California.Schönwetter, M. (1960). Handbuch der Oologie (Ed. W. ME~SE). Vol. 1. Berlin. The average egg size is relatively small, about 20% smaller than Eurasian eagle-owl eggs and 8% smaller than great horned owl eggs.Bendire, C. E. (1892). Life histories of North American birds with special reference to their breeding habits and eggs. U.S. National Museum Special Bulletin 1. Laying intervals are normally 2 days (41–50 hours mostly).Schaanning, H. T. L. (1907). Østfinmarkens fuglefauna. Bergens Mus. Arb. 8:1–98.Pleske, T. (1928). Birds of the Eurasian tundra. Mem. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist. 6:111–485. The laying intervals can range up to 3–5 days in inclement weather.Parmelee, D. F., Stephens, H. A. & Schmidt, R. H. (1967). The birds of Southeastern Victoria Island and adjacent small islands. National Museum of Canada Bulletin 222. The laying of a clutch of 11 eggs can take 20–30 days, while a more typical nest of around 8 takes about up to 16 days. The interval between the 8th and 9th eggs can be up to about 4 days. Incubation begins with the first egg and is by female alone, while she is fed by her mate. Parental behavior A captive mother snowy owl with its chick. Food is brought to the nest by males and surplus food is stored nearby. Females in breeding season often develop a very extensive brood patch which in this species is a fairly enormous, high vascularized featherless area of pink belly skin. Incubation lasts 31.8–33 days (unconfirmed and possibly dubious reports from as little as 27 to as much as 38-day incubations). The female alone broods the young, often while simultaneously incubating still unhatched eggs. Sometimes older chicks incidentally brood their younger siblings and females may shelter the young under her wings during inclement weather. When first feeding the young, the female may dismantle prey to feed the young only the softer body parts then gradually ramping up the size of proportions until they eat a whole prey item. Aggressive encounters with parent snowy owls are said to be \"genuinely dangerous\" and one resource claimed the snowy owl to be the bird species with the most formidable nest defense displays towards humans.Couzens, D. (2008). Extreme Birds: The World\\'s Most Extraordinary and Bizarre Birds. Firefly Books. The usual response to sighted humans near the nest is mild but continued approach begins to increasingly irritate the parents. At times, humans are forcefully dive-bombed upon, while other potential threats are dealt with in a “forward-threat” where the male walks towards the intruders, engaging in impressive feather-raising and fanning out of half-spread wings until they run forward and slash with both their feet and bill. Fairly serious injuries have been sustained in the worst of snowy owl defensive attacks, including cranial trauma, requiring researchers to make the long trek back to medical care, although human fatalities are not known. Snowy owl parents have been seen to aggressively attacked glaucous gulls, arctic fox and dogs in breeding ground in Utqiaġvik. Non-predatory animals like caribou in Utqiaġvik and sheep (Ovis aries) in Fetlar are attacked as well, possibly to avoid potential trampling of the eggs or the young. Males are said to do the majority of nest defense but the female will also often become involved as well. Analysis showed in Lapland, Sweden, that females in nest defense against people engaged in vocal displays (warning and mewing calls) and that males did not engage in mewing but did engage in most hooting calls, many warning calls and almost all physical attacks. In other instances, distraction displays are engaged in against predators, with a \"broken-wing act\" including high, thin squeals interspersed with weird squeaks, often taking flight only to quickly fall from the sky and imitate a struggle.ADW: Nyctea scandiaca: Information. Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu. Retrieved on 19 October 2010. One author recorded a male to draw him about 2 km from the nest before ceasing. 77% of 45 distraction displays in Lapland, Sweden were by females. Development of young An old photo of snowy owl nestlings on Baffin Island. Hatching intervals are generally from 1 to 3 days, quite often within 37–45 hours apart. New chicks are semi-altricial (i.e. typically helpless and blind), initially being white and rather wet but dry by the end of the first day. The weight of 7 hatchlings was 35 to, with an average of 46 g while 3 were 44.7 g. Due to the pronounced asynchrony of the egg-laying and hatching, the size difference between siblings can be enormous and in some cases when the smallest chick weighs only 20 to, the biggest chick already has attained a weight of around 350 to. When the oldest chick is about 3 weeks, the female will start to hunt as well as the male and both may directly feed the young although in some cases they may not need hunt very much if lemmings are particularly numerous. Caches of lemmings around a nest may include more than 80 lemmings that can support the family. Unlike many owls, the chicks of snowy owls are not known to behave aggressively toward one another or to engage in siblicide, perhaps in part due to the need for energy conservance. Some cases of cannibalism of chicks by the family group were thought to be cases where chicks die from other causes. When they are about 2 weeks, the chicks may begin to walk around the nest site which they leave by 18–28 days, although they are still unable to fly and may find safety in nooks and crannies of vegetation and rocks usually only about 1 to from the nest mound, as well as via their parents defense.Romero, L. M., Holt, D. W. Maples M. & Wingfield, J. C.. (2006). Corticosterone is not correlated with nest departure in Snowy Owl chicks (Nyctea scandiaca). General and Comparative Endocrinology 149 (2): 119–123. Leaving the nest is thought to likely be an anti-predator strategy.Holt, D. W. & Leasure, S. M. (1993). Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus). In: The birds of North America, No. 62, edited by A. Poole and F. Gill. Washington, DC: Acad. Nat. Sci., Philadelphia, PA; Am. Ornithol. Union. The male snowy owl may drop fresh prey deliveries directly on the ground near the wandering young. After about three weeks of age, the young may wander fairly widely, rarely to 1 km, but usually stay within 500 m of the nest mound. Threat postures by young in reaction to researchers were first noticeable at about 20–25 days of age and common at about 28 days and the chicks can be impressively quick and agile-footed. The first fledgling occurs at around 35–50 days, and by 50–60 days the young can fly well and hunt on their own. The total care period is for 2–3.5 months, increasing in length with increased size of the brood. Although independence was once thought to be sought by late August or early September but is more likely by late September to October when migration season for the species begins. The nesting cycle is similar in length to the Arctic short-eared owls and faster than Eurasian eagle-owls by up to 2 months.Schrezinger, W. (1974). Zur Ethologie und Jugendentwicklung der Schnee-Eule Nyctea scandiaca nach Beobachtungen in Gefangenschaft. J. Orn, 115: 8–49. Maturity and nesting success Snowy owl, juvenile, in Ontario, Canada. Sexual maturity reached the following year but the first breeding is normally at no sooner than the end of the second year of life. There is little strong evidence of typical age of first breeding but initial breeding by males could be inferred by the plumage of males in Utqiaġvik by plumage. At that stage, which the males were essentially all pure white, most were aged to about 3 to 4 years old. The snowy owl seems to markedly inconsistent in regard to breeding every year, often taking at least up to two years between attempts and sometimes as much as nearly a decade. 7 satellite-marking females in Canada proved that they did breed in consecutive years, with 1 breeding over 3 consecutive years. In 23 years at Utqiaġvik, snowys bred in 13 of them. Nesting success can reach 90–100% in even the largest clutches in high lemming years. While over the course of 21 years, 260 total nests were recorded in Utqiaġvik. There, from 4–54 nests were recorded annually. The Utqiaġvik nests bore 3 to 10 sized-clutches with a mean of 6 eggs per nest and an annual mean hatching success from 39 to 91%. 31–87% of chicks were able to depart on foot and 48–65% were annually estimated to survive to fledge; elsewhere, 40% survived to fledge. In another set, 97% of observed eggs both hatched and fledged. In Norway, the fledging success from 10 nests was much lower at about 46%. Norwegian data, which previously indicated it to be an almost accidental breeder in northern Norway, indicates that it is a more regular breeder than expected, though. 3 good years were found for snowy owls between 1968 and 2005: 1974 (when there were 12 pairs), 1978 (22 pairs) and 1985 (20 pairs), with 14 additional locations when potential (but not confirmed) breeding has occurred. The main determinable causes of nest failure were deemed to be starvation and exposure. A number of Norwegian and Finnish nests were known to fail due to severe black fly parasitism.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'A captive adult male. The snowy owl is mostly white. They are purer white than predatory mammals like polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus). Often when seen in the field, these owls can resemble a pale rock or a lump of snow on the ground. It usually appears to lack ear tufts but very short (and probably vestigial) tufts can be erected in some situations, perhaps most frequently by the female when she is sitting on the nest. The ear tufts measure about 20 to and consist of about 10 small feathers. The snowy owl has bright yellow eyes. The head is relatively small and, even for the relatively simply adapted hearing mechanism of a Bubo owl, the facial disc is shallow and the ear is uncomplicated. 1 male had ear slits of merely 21 x on left and 21 x on the right. Females are almost invariably more duskily patterned than like-age males. In mature males, the upper parts are plain white with usually a few dark spots on the miniature ear-tufts, about the head and the tips of some primaries and secondaries whilst the underside is often pure white. Despite their reputation for being purely white, only 3 out of 129 Russian museum specimens of adult males showed an almost complete absence of darker spots. The adult female is usually considerably more spotted and often slightly barred with dark brown on the crown and the underparts. Her flight and tail feathers are faintly barred brown while the underparts are white in base color with brown spotting and barring on the flanks and upper breast. In confusingly plumaged snowy owls, the sex can be determined by the shape of wing markings, which manifest as bars more so in females and spots in males. However, the very darkest males and the lightest females are nearly indistinguishable by plumage. On rare occasion, a female can appear almost pure white, as has been recorded in both the field and in captivity.McMorris, A. (2011). Snowy Owls: Age, Sex and Plumage. Presentation Delaware Valley Ornithological Club. There is some evidence that some of the species grow paler with age after maturity.Dementiev, G. P., Gladkov, N. A., Ptushenko, E. S., Spangenberg, E. P., & Sudilovskaya, A. M. (1966). Birds of the Soviet Union, vol. 1. Israel Program for Scientific Translations, Jerusalem. One study\\'s conclusions were that males were usually but not always lighter and that correctly aging is extremely difficult, sometimes individuals either get lighter, darker or do not change their appearance with age. On the other hand, with close study, it is possible to visually identify even individual snowy owls using the pattern of markings on the wing, which can be somewhat unique in each individual. After a fresh moult, some adult females that previously appeared relatively pale newly evidenced dark, heavy markings. On the contrary, some banded individuals over at least four years were observed to have been almost entirely unchanged in the extent of their markings. In another very pale owl, the barn owl (Tyto alba), the sexual dimorphism of spotting appears to be driven by genetics while, in snowy owls, environment may be the dictating factor instead. A captive adult female. The chicks are initially grayish white but quickly transition to dark gray-brown in the mesoptile plumage. This type of plumage camouflages effectively against the variously colored lichens that dot the tundra ground. This is gradually replaced by plumage showing dark barring on white. At the point of fledging, the plumage often becomes irregularly mottled or blotched with dark and is mostly solidly dark gray-brown above with white eyebrows and other areas of the face white. Recently fledged young can already be sexed to a semi-reliable degree by the dark marking patterns about their wings. The juvenile plumage resembles that of adult females but averages slightly darker on average. By their second moult fewer or more broken bars are usually evidenced on the wing. The extent of white and composition of wing patterns become more dimorphic by sex with each juvenile moult, culminating in the 4th or 5th pre-basic moult, wherein the owls are hard to distinguish from mature adults. Moults usually occur from July and September, non-breeding birds moulting later and more extensively, and are never extensive enough to render the owls flightless. Evidence indicates that snowy owls may attain adult plumage at 3 to 4 years of age, but fragmentary information suggests that some males are not fully mature and/or as fully white in plumage that they can attain until the 9th or 10th year. Generally speaking, moults of snowy owls occur more quickly than do those of Eurasian eagle-owls. The toes of the snowy owl are extremely thickly feathered white, while the claws are black. The toe feathers are the longest known of any owl, averaging at 33.3 mm, against the great horned owl which has the 2nd longest toe feathers at a mean of 13 mm Occasionally, snowy owls may show a faint blackish edge to the eyes and have a dark gray cere, though this is often not visible from the feather coverage, and a black bill. Unlike many other whitish birds, the snowy owl does not possess black wingtips, which is theorized to minimize wear-and-tear on the wing feathers in the other whitish bird types. The conspicuously notched primaries of the snowy owl appear to give an advantage over similar owls in long-distance flight and more extensive flapping flight. The snowy owl does have some of the noise-canceling serrations and comb-like wing feathers that render the flight of most owls functionally silent, but they have fewer than most related Bubo owls. Therefore, in combination with its less soft feathers, the flight of a snowy owl can be somewhat audible at close range. The flight of snowy owls tends to be steady and direct and is reminiscent to some of the flight of a large, slow-flying falcon. Though capable of occasional gliding flight, there is no evidence that snowy owls will soar. It is said that the species seldom exceeds a flying height of around 150 m even during passage. While the feet are sometimes described as \"enormous\", the tarsus is in osteological terms relatively short at 68% the length of those of a Eurasian eagle-owl but the claws are nearly as large, at 89% of the size of those of the eagle-owl. Despite its relatively short length, the tarsus is of similar circumference as in other Bubo owls. Also compared to an eagle-owl, the snowy owl has a relatively short decurved rostrum, a proportionately greater length to the interorbital roof and a much longer sclerotic ring surrounding the eyes while the anterior opening are the greatest known in any owl. Owls have extremely large eyes which are nearly the same size in large species such as the snowy owl as those of humans.Gill, F. (2007). Ornithology. 3rd Edn. (W. H. Freeman Co: New York. The snowy owl\\'s eye, at about 23.4 mm in diameter, is slightly smaller than those of great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls but is slightly larger than those of some other large owls. Snowy owls must be able to see from great distances and in highly variable conditions but probably possess less acute night vision than many other owls. Based on the study of dioptres in different owl species, the snowy owl was determined to have eyesight better suited to long-range perception than to close discrimination, while some related species such as great horned owls could probably more successful perceive closer objects. Despite their visual limits, snowy owls may have up to 1.5 times more visual acuity than humans. Like other owls, snowy owls can probably perceive all colors but cannot perceive ultraviolet visual pigments. Owls have the largest brains of any bird (increasing in sync with the size of the owl species), with the size of the brain and eye related less to intelligence than perhaps to increased nocturnality and predatory behavior. Size Young owl on the tundra at Utqiaġvik, Alaska. Snowy owls lose their black feathers with age, although individual females may retain some The snowy owl is a very large owl. They are the largest avian predator of the High Arctic and one of the largest owls in the world. Snowy owls are about the sixth or seventh heaviest living owl on average, around the fifth longest and perhaps the third longest winged.Weidensaul, S. (2015). Owls of North America and the Caribbean. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. This species is the heaviest and longest winged owl (as well as the second longest) in North America, the second heaviest and longest winged owl in Europe (and third longest) but is outsized in bulk by about 3 to 4 other species in Asia. Despite being sometimes described as of similar size, the snowy owl is somewhat larger in all aspects of average size than the great horned owl while the similarly specialized taiga-dwelling great grey owl (Strix nebulosa), is longer in total length and of similar dimensions in standard measurements, but is shorter winged and much less heavy than the snowy owl. In Eurasia, the Eurasian eagle-owl is larger in all standards of measurements than the snowy owl not to mention two additional species each from Africa and Asia that are slightly to considerably heavier on average than the snowy owl. Like most birds of prey, the snowy owl shows reverse sexual dimorphism relative to most non-raptorial birds in that females are larger than males. Sexual dimorphism that favors the female may have some correlation with being able to more effectively withstand food shortages such as during brooding as well as the rigors associated with incubating and brooding. Females are sometimes described as “giant” whereas males appear relatively “neat and compact”. However, the sexual dimorphism is relatively less pronounced compared to some other Bubo species. Male snowy owls have been known to measure from 52.5 to in total length, with an average from four large samples of 58.7 cm and a maximum length, perhaps in need of verification, of reportedly 70.7 cm.Eckert, A. W. (1987). The Owls of North America, North of Mexico: All the Species and Subspecies Illustrated in Color and Fully Described. Gramercy.Parmelee, D. F. (1972). Canada\\'s incredible arctic owls. Beaver no. summer:30–41.Priklonskiy, S.G. (1993). Snowy Owl — Nyctea scandiaca (Linnaeus, 1758). In: Birds of Russia and adjoining regions: Pterocliformes, Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes. Moscow, p. 258–270. (in Russian). In wingspan, males may range from 116 to, with a mean of 146.6 cm. In females, total length has been known to range from 54 to, with a mean of 63.7 cm and an unverified maximum length of perhaps 76.7 cm (if so they would have the second longest maximum length of any living owl, after only the great grey owl). Female wingspans have reportedly measured from 146 to, with a mean of 159 cm. Despite one study claiming that snowy owl had the highest wing loading (i.e. grams per square cm of wing area) of any of 15 well-known owl species, more extensive sampling demonstratively illustrated that the wing loading of snowy owls is notably lower than Eurasian eagle- and great horned owls. The conspicuously long-winged profile of a flying snowy owl compared to these related species may cause some to compare their flight profile to a bulkier version of an enormous Buteo or a large falcon. Body mass in males can average from 1465 to, with a median of 1658.2 g and a full weight range of 1300 to from six sources. Body mass in females can average from 1706.7 to, with a median of 2101.8 g and a full weight range of 1330 to.National Geographic Society. \"Snowy Owl\". Larger than the aforementioned body mass studies, a massive pooled dataset at six wintering sites in North America showed that 995 males averaged at 1636 g while 1,189 females were found to average 2109 g. Reported weights of down to 710 g for males and of 780 to for females are probably in reference to owls in a state of starvation. Such emaciated individuals are known to highly impaired and starvation deaths are probably not infrequent in winters with poor food accesses. Snowy owls have powerful feet that are heavily covered with feathering. Standard measurements have been even more widely reported than length and wingspan. The wing chord of males can vary from 351 to, averaging from 380.1 to with a median of 402.8 mm. The wing chord of females can vary from 380 to, averaging from 416.2 to with a median of 435.5 mm. The tail length of males can vary on average from 209.6 to, with a full range of 188 to and a median of 227 mm. The tail length of females can average from 228.5 to, with a full range of 205 to and a median of 244.4 mm. Data indicates that slightly longer wing chord and tail lengths were reported on average in Russian data than in American research, however the weights were not significantly different in the two regions. Less widely taken measurements include the culmen, which can measure from 24.6 to with a median average of 26.3 mm in males and 27.9 mm in females, and the total bill length which is from 25 to, with an average in both sexes of 35.6 mm. Tarsal length in males averages about 63.6 mm, with a range of 53 to, and averages about 66 mm, with a range of 54 to, in females. Identification Male snowy owls such as this are particularly distinctive due to the extensive whiteness. The snowy owl is certainly one of the most unmistakable owls (or perhaps even animals) in the world. No other species attains the signature white stippled sparsely with black-brown color of these birds, a coloring which renders their bright yellow eyes all the more detectable, nor possesses their obvious extremely long feathering. The only other owl to breed in the High Arctic is the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus). Both species inhabit open country, overlap in range and are often seen by day, but the short-eared is much smaller and more tan or straw-colored in coloration, with streaked brown on chest. Even the palest short-eared owls conspicuously differ and are darker than the snowy owl; additionally the short-eared most often hunts in extended flights.Pyle, P. (1997). Identification Guide to North American Birds, Part I: Columbidae to Ploceidae. Slate Creek Press, Bolinas, CA, USA. More similar owls such as the Eurasian eagle-owl and the great horned owl attain a fairly pale, sometimes white-washed look in their northernmost races. These species do not normally breed nearly as far north as snowy owls but overlaps certainly do occur when snowy owls when the latter owl sometimes comes south in winter. However, even the most pale great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls are still considerably more heavily marked with darker base colors than snowy owls (the whitest eagle-owls are paler than the whitest great horned owls), possess much larger and more conspicuous ear tufts and lack the bicolored appearance of the darkest snowy owls. While the great horned owl has yellow eyes like the snowy owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl tends to have bright orange eyes. The open terrain habitats normally used by wintering snowy owls are also distinct from the typical edge and rocky habitats usually favored by the great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls, respectively. Vocalizations The snowy owl differ in their calls from other Bubo owls, with a much more barking quality to their version of a hooting song. Perhaps as many as 15 different calls by mature snowy owls have been documented.Sutton, G. M. (1932). The exploration of Southampton Island. Part II, Zoölogy. Section 2.-The birds of Southampton Island. Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum 12 (2):1–275. The main vocalization is a monotonous sequence that normally contains 2–6 (but occasionally more), rough notes similar to the rhythm of a barking dog: krooh krooh krooh krooh... The call may end with an emphatic aaoow, which is somewhat reminiscent of the deep alarm call of a great black-backed gull (Larus marinus). They will call mainly from a perch but also sometimes do so in flight. The krooh call of the male snowy owl may perform multiple functions such as competitive exclusion of other males and advertising to females.Taylor, P.S. (1973). Breeding behaviour of the Snowy Owl. Living Bird. 12: 137–154. The calls of this species may carry exceptionally far in the thin air of Arctic, certainly over more than 3 km, and maybe even to as much 10 to away. The female has a similar call to male but can be higher-pitched and/or more guttural as well as single notes which are often disyllabic, khuso. Female snowy owls have also been known to utter chirps and high screaming notes, similar to those of the nestlings. Both sexes may at times give a series of clucking, squeals, grunts, hisses and cackles, perhaps such as in circumstances when they are excited. The alarm call is a loud, grating, hoarse keeea. Another raspier bark is recorded, sometimes called a \"watchman\\'s rattle\" call, and may be transcribed as rick, rick, rick, ha, how, quack, quock or kre, kre, kre, kre, kre. A female attacking to protect her nest was recorded to let out a crowed ca-ca-oh call, whilst other owls attacking to protect the nest did a loud version of the typical call while circling before dropping down. They may also clap their beak in response to threats or annoyances. While called clapping, it is believed this sound may actually be a clicking of the tongue, not the beak. Though largely only vocal in the breeding season, leading to some erroneous older accounts describing the snowy owl as completely silent, some vocalizations have been recorded in winter in the northern United States. Initially, the young of the snowy owl have a high pitched and soft begging call which develops into a strong, wheezy scream at around 2 weeks. At the point when the young owls leave the nest around 3 weeks, the shrill squeals they emit may allow the mothers to locate them. Juvenile snowy owl, about 12 weeks old'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Breeding range The snowy owl is typically found in the northern circumpolar region, where it makes its summer home north of latitude 60° north though sometimes down to 55 degrees north. However, it is a particularly nomadic bird, and because population fluctuations in its prey species can force it to relocate, it has been known to breed at more southerly latitudes. Although the total breeding range includes a little over 12000000 km2, only about 1300000 km2 have a high probability of breeding, i.e. breeding at no more than 3–9-year intervals. Snowy owls nest in the Arctic tundra of the northernmost stretches of Alaska, Northern Canada, and Eurosiberia. Bobby Tulloch, the Shetland RSPB warden, at the site of the snowy owl nest on the island of Fetlar, Shetland, in August 1967 Between 1967 and 1975, snowy owls bred on the remote island of Fetlar in the Shetland Isles north of mainland Scotland, discovered by the Shetland RSPB warden, Bobby Tulloch. Females summered as recently as 1993, but their status in the British Isles is now that of a rare winter visitor to Shetland, the Outer Hebrides and the Cairngorms.\"Hope of first owl chicks in years\", BBC News. 13 May 2008. Older records show that the snowy owls may have once semi-regularly bred elsewhere in the Shetlands. They range in northern Greenland (mostly Peary Land) and, rarely in \"isolated parts of the highlands\", Iceland. Thence, they are found breeding at times across northern Eurasia such as in Spitsbergen and western and northern Scandinavia. In Norway, they normally breed in Troms og Finnmark and seldom down as far south as Hardangervidda and in Sweden perhaps down to the Scandinavian Mountains while breeding is very inconsistent in Finland.Saurola, P. L. (1997). Monitoring Finnish owls 1982–1996: methods and results. United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service General Technical Report NC, pp. 363–380. They also range in much of northern Russia, including northern Siberia, Anadyr, Koryakland, Taymyr Peninsula, Yugorsky Peninsula, Sakha (especially the Chukochya River) and Sakhalin. Breeding have also been reported sporadically to the south in the Komi Republic and even the Kama River in southern Perm Krai. Although considered part of the regular range, the last breeding by snowy owls in the Kola Peninsula was not since the early 1980s; similarly, breeding maps show the species in Arkhangelsk Oblast and the Pay-Khoy Ridge but no breeding records known in at least 30 years in either.Mineev, O. Y. & Minnev, Y. N. (2005). Distribution of owls in North-East European tundra. In: Owls of the Northern Eurasia (eds. Volkov S.V., Morozov V.V. & Sharikov A.V.). They range throughout most of the Arctic isles of Russia such as Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island, Commander and Hall Islands. In North America, the breeding range has been known in modern times to include the Aleutians (i.e. Buldir and Attu) and much of northern Alaska, most frequently from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to Utqiaġvik, and more sporadically down along the coastal-western parts such as through Nome, Hooper Bay, the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, and rarely even south to the Shumagin Islands. The snowy owl may breed extensively in northern Canada, largely making its home in the Arctic Archipelago. Their Canadian breeding range can include broadly Ellesmere Island up to Cape Sheridan, north coastal Labrador, the northern Hudson Bay, perhaps all of Nunavut (especially the Kivalliq Region), northeastern Manitoba, both most of northern mainland and insular Northwest Territories (including the delta of the Mackenzie River) and northern Yukon Territory (where breeding is mostly confined to Herschel Island). Since breeding and distribution is very small, local and inconsistent in northern Europe, northern Canada and northern Alaska represent the core part of the breeding range for snowy owls along with several parts of northern and northeastern/coastal Russia. Regular wintering range Wing structure During the wintering, many snowy owls leave the dark Arctic to migrate to regions further south. Southern limits of the regular winter range are difficult to delineate given the inconsistency of appearances south of the Arctic. Furthermore, not infrequently, many snowy owls will overwinter somewhere in the Arctic through the winter, though seldom appear to do so in the same sites where they have bred. Due in no small part to the difficulty and hazardousness of observation for biologists during these harsh times, there is very limited data on overwintering snowy owls in the tundra, including how many occur, where they winter and what their ecology is at this season. The regular wintering range has at times been thought to include Iceland, Ireland and Scotland and across northern Eurasia such as southern Scandinavia, the Baltics, central Russia, southwestern Siberia, Sakhalin southern Kamchatka and, rarely, north China and sometimes the Altai Republic. In North America, they occasionally regularly winter in the Aleutian island chain and do so broadly and with a fair amount of consistency in much of southern Canada, from British Columbia to Labrador. Recent research has indicated that snowy owls regularly winter in several of the northern seas during wintertime, following the leads of sea ice as perching sites and presumably hunting mostly seabirds in polynyas. In February 1886, a snowy owl landed on the rigging of the Nova Scotia steamship Ulunda on the edge of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, over 800 km from the nearest land. It was captured and later preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum.Conlin, Dan (2 October 2013). \"An Owl Oddity\", Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. Surprisingly, some studies have determined that after a high lemming year in North America, a higher percentage of snowy owls were using marine environments rather than inland ones. Irruptive range Large winter irruptions at temperate latitudes are thought to be due to good breeding conditions resulting in more juvenile migrants. These result in irruptions occurring further south than the typical snowy owl range in some years. They have been reported, as well as in all northerly states in the contiguous states,Root, T. R. (1988). Atlas of Wintering North American Birds: An Analysis of Christmas Bird Count Data. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, USA. as far south as the Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, nearly all the Gulf Coast of the United States, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, Utah, California and even Hawaii. In January 2009, a snowy owl appeared in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting in the state since 1987.\"Snowy Owl Appears in Middle Tennessee.\" The Styling Owlish. 24 January 2009. Also notable is the mass southern migration in the winter of 2011/2012, when thousands of snowy owls were spotted in various locations across the United States.Zuckerman, Laura (28 January 2012). Snowy owls soar south from Arctic in rare mass migration. Reuters This was then followed by an even larger mass southern migration in 2013/2014 with the first snowy owls seen in Florida for decades. The nature of irruptions is less well-documented in Eurasia, in part due to the paucity of this owl in the European side, but accidental occurrence, presumably during irruptions, has been described in the Mediterranean area, France, Crimea, the Caspian part of Iran, Kazakhstan, northern Pakistan, northwestern India, Korea and Japan. Stragglers may too turn up as far south as the Azores and Bermuda. Habitat Snowy owls often seek out grassy and open habitats year around. Snowy owls are one of the best known inhabitants of the open Arctic tundra. Frequently, the earth in snowy owl breeding grounds is covered with mosses, lichens and some rocks. Often the species preferentially occurs in areas with some rising elevation such as hummocks, knolls, ridges, bluffs and rocky outcrops. Some of these rises in the tundra are created by glacial deposits. The ground is usually rather dry in tundra but in some areas of the southern tundra can also be quite marshy. Not infrequently, they will also use areas of varied coastal habitat, often tidal flats, as a breeding site. Breeding sites are usually at low elevations, usually less than 300 m above sea level, but when breeding to the south in inland mountains, such as in Norway, they may nest at as high as 1000 m. Outside the breeding season, snowy owls may habituate nearly any open landscape. Typically wintering sites are rather windswept with meager cover. These open areas can include those such as coastal dunes, other coastal spots, lakeshores, islands, moorlands, steppes, meadows, prairies, other extensive grasslands and rather shrubby areas of the Subarctic. These may be favored due to their vague similarity to the flat openness of the tundra. Manmade open sites are now perhaps even more used than natural ones, often agricultural fields and rangeland, as well as large areas of cleared forests. During irruption years when they are found in the Northeastern United States, juveniles frequent developed areas including urban areas and golf courses, as well as the expected grasslands and agricultural areas that older birds primarily use. On the plains of Alberta, observed snowy owls spent 30% of their time in stubble-fields, 30% in summer fallow, 14% in hayfield and the remainder of the time in pasture, natural grasslands and sloughs. The agricultural areas, large untouched by the farmers in winter, may have had more concentrated prey than the others in Alberta. Perhaps the most consistently attractive habitat in North America to wintering snowy owls in modern times may be airports, which not only tend to have the flat, grassy characteristics of their preferred habitats but also by winter host a particular diversity of prey, both pests which rely on humans as well as wildlife attracted to the extensively grassy and marshy strips that dot the large airport vicinities. For example, Logan International Airport in Massachusetts has one relatively one of the most reliable annual populations known in the United States in winter. All ages spend a fair amount of their time over water in the Bering Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and even the Great Lakes, mostly on ice floes. These marine and ocean-like freshwater areas were observed to account for 22–31% of habitat used in 34 radio-tagged American snowy owls over two irruptive years, with the tagged owls occurring a mean of 3 km from the nearest land (while 35–58% used the expected preferred habitats of grassland, pasture and other agriculture).'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Hunting techniques A snowy owl engaging in the \"sweep\" hunting method. Snowy owls may hunt at nearly at any time of the day or night, but may not attempt to do so during particularly severe weather. During the summer solstice, the owls appear to hunt during \"theoretical nightfall\". Night-vision devices have allowed biologists to observe that snowy owls hunt quite often during the extended nighttime during the northern winter. Prey are both taken and eaten on the ground. Snowy owls, like other carnivorous birds, often swallow their small prey whole. Strong stomach juices digest the flesh, while the indigestible bones, teeth, fur, and feathers are compacted into oval pellets that the bird regurgitates 18 to 24 hours after feeding. Regurgitation often takes place at regular perches, where dozens of pellets may be found. Biologists frequently examine these pellets to determine the quantity and types of prey the birds have eaten. When large prey are eaten in small pieces, pellets will not be produced.Snowy Owl — Bubo scandiacus, formerly Nyctea scandiaca. owlpages.com Larger prey is often torn apart, sometimes include removal of the head, with the large muscles, such as the humerus or breast, typically eaten first. The scattering of remains that results from the increment feeding on larger prey is thought to result in under-identification of them compared to smaller prey items. The aptitude for hunting by day, hunting from the ground and hunting in almost always completely open and treeless areas are the primary ways in which the snowy owl differs in hunting from other Bubo owls. Otherwise, the hunting habits are similar.Johnsgard, P. A. (1988). North American owls: biology and natural history. Smithsonian Institution. It is thought, due to their less refined hearing compared to other owls, prey is usually perceived via vision and movement. Experiments indicate that snowy owls can detect prey from as far as 1.6 km away. Snowy owls generally use a rise or, occasionally, a perch while hunting. 88% of observed 34 hunts in Utqiaġvik were undertaken from an elevated watch-site (56% mounds or rises, 37% telephone poles). Their hunting style may recall that of buzzards, with the hunting owl sitting rather low and perching immobile for a long spell. Although their usual flight is a slow, deliberate downbeat on the broad, fingered wings, when prey is detected from their perch, flight may undertaken with a sudden, surprisingly quick accelerated style with interspersed wing beats. In Utqiaġvik, snowy owls may most frequently engage in a brief pursuit hunting style. In high winds capable of keeping their bulk aloft, snowy owls may too engage in a brief hovering flight before dropping onto prey. When hunting fish, apparently, some snowy owls will hover in a style reminiscent of the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), although in at least one other case a snowy owl was observed to capture fish by lying on its belly upon a rock by a fishing hole.Audubon, J. J. (1840). The Birds of America. Dover Publications, Inc., New York, NY, USA. A dashing stoop or pounce down onto their prey, ending in a high-impact \"wallop\", is fairly commonly recorded. Another common technique is the \"sweep\", wherein they fly by and grasp the prey while continuing to fly. In winter, snowy owls have been shown to be able to \"snow plunge\" to capture prey in the subnivean zone, under at least 20 cm of snow. Perhaps least frequently, snowy owls may pursue their prey on foot, in doing so never taking wing. Snowy owls have been known to capture night-migrating passerines and shorebirds, sometimes perhaps on the wing, as well as large and/or potentially dangerous birds that were caught in air by snowy owls during daylight. On the wing pursuits against other various other carnivorous birds are sometimes undertaken as well to kleptoparasitize the prey caught by the other birds. Few variations of hunting technique were observed in winter observations from Alberta, almost all of the hunts being with the sit-and-wait method (also known as still-hunts). Adult females in Alberta had a considerably better hunting rate than juvenile females. Much as in Alberta, in Syracuse, New York, 90% of 51 hunts were still-hunting, with the sweep variant used after perch departure in 31% of hunts and the pounce method in 45% of hunts. The Syracuse-wintering owls used tall perches, a mixture of manmade objects and trees of around 6 m high, in nearly 61% of hunts, while nearly 14% were from low perches (i.e. fence-posts, snow banks and scrap piles) about half as high as the tall perches and started from a ground position nearly 10% of the time.Winter, R. E. (2016). Hunting Behaviors and Foraging Success of Winter Irruptive Snowy Owls in New York. SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Thesis. In Sweden, males hunted from a perch more so than did females and adults both focused on significantly smaller prey (small mammals) and may have had more success hunting than juvenile snowy owls. Some snowy owls can survive a fast for up to about 40 days off of fat reserves. These owls were found to have extremely thick subcutaneous fat deposits of 19 to and it is likely owls that overwinter in the Arctic rely heavily on these to survive during this scarce time, in combination with lethargic, energy-conserving behavior. Snowy owls may not infrequently exploit prey inadvertently provided or compromised by human activities, including ducks injured by duck hunters, birds maimed by antenna wires, various animals caught in human traps and traplines as well as domestic or wild prey being bred or farmed by humans in enclosures. A wide variety of accrued reports show that the snowy owl that scavenging on carrion is not uncommon (despite having once been thought to be very rare in all owls), including instances of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) body parts brought to nests and owls following polar bears to secondarily feed on their kills. Even huge marine mammals such as walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) and whales can be fed upon by these owls when the opportunity occurs. Snowy owls produce a pellet that in different areas averages a median of about 80 x, averaging up to 92 mm in length as in Europe. Prey spectrum A snowy owl flying with an unidentified prey item in winter. The snowy owl is primarily a hunter of mammals. Most especially, they often live off of the northerly lemmings. Sometimes other similar rodents like voles can also be found frequently in the snowy owl\\'s foods. It is R-selected, meaning that it is an opportunistic breeder capable of taking advantage of increases in prey numbers and diversity, despite its apparent specialization. Birds are commonly taken as well, and may regularly include passerines, northern seabirds, ptarmigan and ducks, among others. Sometimes infrequent consumption of other prey such as beetles, crustaceans and occasionally amphibians and fish is reported (of these only fish are known to have been identified to prey species). All told, more than 200 prey species have been known to be taken by snowy owls around the world. Generally, like other large owls (including even bigger owls like the Eurasian eagle-owl), prey selection tends toward quite small prey, usually small mammals, but they can alternate freely with prey that is much larger than typical given the opportunity or even bigger than themselves, including relatively large mammals and several types of large bird of almost any age.Marti, C. D., Korpimäki, E., & Jaksić, F. M. (1993). \"Trophic structure of raptor communities: a three-continent comparison and synthesis\". In Current ornithology, pp. 47–137. Springer, Boston, MA. One study estimated for the biomes of Alaska and Canada, mean prey sizes for snowy owls were 49.1 g, in western North America, the mean prey size was 506 g and in eastern North America was 59.7 g, while the mean prey size in northern Fennoscandia was similar (at 55.4 g). The mean number of prey species for snowy owls per biome ranged from 12 to 28. The opportunistic nature of snowy owls has long been known during their primarily winter observed feeding habits (leading to their unpopular nature and frequent persecution well into the 20th century). Summer diet Lemmings such as Norway lemmings are the primary prey of breeding snowy owls. The snowy owl\\'s biology is closely tied to the availability of lemmings. These herbivorous rodents are largish members of the vole clan that are the predominant mammal of the tundra ecosystem alongside the reindeer and probably make up the majority of the mammalian biomass of the ecosystem. Lemmings are key architects of the soil, microtopography and plant life of the entire tundra.Fitzgerald, B.M. (1981). \"Predatory birds and mammals\". In Tundra ecosystems: a comparative analysis. Eds L.C. Bliss, 0.W. Heal & J.J. Moore, pp. 485–508. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. In the American lower Arctic areas, brown lemming of the Lemmus genus are predominant and tend to be found in lower, wetter habitats (feeding by preference on grasses sedges and mosses) while collared lemmings of the Dicrostonyx genus were in more arid, often higher elevation habitats with heathland and ate by preference willow leaves and forbs. The southerly brown lemmings behave differently than more northern collared lemming type, increasing almost limitlessly within preferred habitat whereas the collared type tends to spread to suboptimal habitats and therefore does not appear reach the high regional densities of the brown. Authorities now generally agree that there appears to be no synchrony between the brown and collared lemmings and the feeding access of snowy owls is irregular as a result, but snowy owls can likely alternate between the two lemming types as one or the other increases as they nomadically use different parts of the Arctic. It is possible that the rare coincidental mutual peak of both lemming types within a year results in the erratic high productivity that results in irruptions. Within individual Arctic lemming species, historically, populations can vary in rough 4- to 5-year trends. As a result, in areas such as Banks Island, the breeding rate of snowy owls can vary within a decade by about tenfold. Weights of lemmings taken can range from 30 to on Baffin Island, while those taken in Utqiaġvik averaged 70.3 and in female and male lemming, respectively. It was estimated based on captive daily food intake that a snowy owl may consume about 326 g of lemmings a day, though other estimates using voles show a daily need for about 145 to. On Southampton Island, 97% of the diet was lemmings. A very similar number of lemmings (nearly 100%) were found over 25 years of study in Utqiaġvik, amongst 42,177 cumulative prey items. Of 76 lemmings that could be identified to sex at a cache, male lemmings were found in the cache twice as often as female lemmings. While initial findings indicated on Wrangel Island that female lemmings outnumbered males in prey remains, to the contrary osteology indicated that, like Utqiaġvik, males were more often taken. However, the slightly larger, slower-moving females may be preferred when available.Krechmar, A.V. & Dorogoy, I.V . (1981). \"Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca)\". In: Ecology of mammals and birds in Wrangel Island. Vladivostok: DVNZ AN SSSR: pp. 56–81. In some areas, snowy owls can breed where lemmings are uncommon to essentially absent. Even in Utqiaġvik, where the diet is quite homogenously based in lemmings, the hatching of passerines, shorebirds and waterfowl can provide a key resource when lemmings are not found regularly and may be the only means by which the young can survive at such lean times. In the Nome, Alaska area, the locally nesting snowy owls reportedly switched from lemmings to ptarmigans when the latter\\'s chicks hatched. A somewhat varying diet was also reported in Prince of Wales Island, Nunavut where 78.3% of the biomass was lemmings, with 17.8% from waterfowl, 3.3% from weasel and about 1% from other birds. In Fennoscandia, among 2,700 prey items only a third were Norway lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) and a majority were voles at 50.6%, probably largely the tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus). A more detailed glance at Finnish Lapland showed that amongst 2,062 prey items, 32.5% of the foods were Norway lemmings (though in some years the balance could range up to 58.1%), 28% were grey red-backed voles (Myodes rufocanus) and 12.6% were tundra voles, with birds constituting a very small amount of the prey balance (1.1%). In northern Sweden, a more homogenous diet was found with the Norway lemming constituting about 90% of the foods. In the Yamal Peninsula, 40% of the diet was collared lemmings, 34% were Siberian brown lemming (Lemmus sibiricus), 13% were Microtus voles and ptarmigan and ducks both constituting 8% and with other birds making up much of the remaining balance. In some parts of the tundra, snowy owls may opportunistically prey upon Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). In the Hooper Bay area (much farther south than they usually nest), various rodents, in highland areas, and waterfowl, in marshland, were taken while breeding.Brackney, A. W. & King, R. J. (1991). Population shifts by Snowy Owls on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. Abstract. In Alaska Bird Conference and Workshop. Anchorage. When historically breeding on Fetlar in Shetland, the main prey for snowy owls was European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), parasitic jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) and Eurasian whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), in roughly that order, followed by other bird species with most (rabbits and secondary birds) prey taken as adults but for the oystercatchers and jaegers which were taken largely as fully grown but only recently fledged juveniles. 22–26% of oystercatcher and jaeger young in the island were estimated to be taken by snowy owls. Bird predation by nesting snowy owls is highly opportunistic. Willow (Lagopus lagopus) and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) of any age are often fairly regular in the diet of breeding snowy owls but they cannot be said to particularly specialize on these. Evidence was found in the Yamal Peninsula that the snowy owls became the primary predator of willow ptarmigan and that the predation was so frequent, it may have been the cause of the change of their habitat usage to willow thickets by the local ptarmigan.Tarasov, V. V. (2011). Summer flocks of the Willow Ptarmigan in the north of the Yamal Peninsula. In: R. T. Watson, T. J. Cade, M. Fuller, G. Hunt, and E. Potapov (Eds.). Gyrfalcons and Ptarmigan in a Changing World. The Peregrine Fund, Boise, Idaho, USA. The reliance on ptarmigan has caused some conservation trickle-down concern for the owls because ptarmigan are hunted in large numbers, with the hunters of Norway permitted to cull up to 30% of the regional population. In North America, avian prey on the breeding ground regularly varies from small passerines like snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) and Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) to large waterfowl like king (Somateria spectabilis) and common eider (Somateria mollissima) and usually the goslings but also occasionally adults of geese such as brants (Branta bernicla), snow geese (Anser caerulescens) and cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii). Drake eiders of often similar size to the owls themselves are not infrequently the largest prey amongst remains around the nest mound. One nest had the bodies of all eiders that attempting to nest in the vicinity around it.Dorogoy, I.V . (1987). Ecology of small mammal predators in Wrangel Island and their role in the dynamics of lemming numbers. Vladivostok: DVO AN SSSR. (In Russian). The threatened and declining Steller\\'s eider (Polysticta stelleri) when nesting in the Utqiaġvik area would appear to avoid the vicinity of snowy owl nests when selecting their own nesting sites due to the predation risk. Intermediately sized seabirds are often focused on in lieu of available lemmings. Foods were studied intensively in Iceland. Among 257 prey items found with a total prey mass of 73.6 kg, birds made up 95% of the diet. The leading prey were adult rock ptarmigan, at 29.6% by number and 55.4% by biomass and adult European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria), at 10.5% by number and 7.2% biomass. The rest of the balance was largely other shorebirds, which were taken slightly more often as chicks than adults. Pink-footed geese (Anser fabalis) were taken in equal number as goslings and adults, with respectively estimated average weights at these ages of 800 and. On the isle of Agattu, the diet consisted entirely of birds, as there are no mammals found there. The much favored food in Agattu was the ancient murrelet (Synthliboramphus antiquus), at 68.4% of the biomass and 46% by number, while the secondary prey were followed numerically by smaller Leach\\'s storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) (20.8%) and Lapland longspurs (10%) and in biomass by smallish ducks, the green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis) and harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) (13.4% biomass collectively). In the Murman Coast of Russia, also in the absence of lemmings, seabirds formed the largest part of the diet.Krasnov, Y. (1985). To the biology of the Snowy Owl in the Eastern Murman. Birds of Prey and Owls in the Nature Reserves of the Russian Federation. TSNIL GLAVOKHOTA, pp. 110–116. Winter diet Snowy owl carries its kill, an American black duck, Biddeford Pool, Maine On the wintering grounds, mammals often predominate in the snowy owl\\'s food inland doing so less in coastal areas. Overall wintering snowy owls eat more diverse foods they do whilst breeding, furthermore coastal wintering snowy owls had more diverse diets than inland ones. As in summer, moderately sized water birds such as teal, northern pintail (Anas acuta) and numerous alcids and the like are often focused on when hunting birds. The diet in 62 pellets, amongst at least 75 prey items, from coastal Oregon showed the main foods as black rat (Rattus rattus) (at an estimated 40%), red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) (31%) and bufflehead (Bucephala albeola) (19%). Witnessed attacks were mostly upon buffleheads in Oregon. In coastal southwestern British Columbia, the diet among 139 prey items was 100% avian. The predominant prey were water birds, mostly snatched directly from surface of the water and largely weighing 400 to, i.e. buffleheads (at 24% by number and 17.4% by biomass of foods) and horned grebes (Podiceps auritus) (at 34.9% by number and 24.6% by biomass), followed by variously other water birds, often the slightly larger species of glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) and the American wigeon (Mareca americana). A different study of this area also showed the predominance of ducks and other water birds to wintering snowy owls here, although Townsend\\'s vole (Microtus townsendii ) (10.65%) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) (5.7%) were also notably in a sample of 122 prey items. During winter, snowy owls consume more strongly nocturnal prey than lemmings such as Peromyscus mice and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In southern Alberta, 248 prey items were found with North American deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), at 54.8% by number, and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanica), at 27% by number, as the main foods of snowy owls over two years. Other prey in Alberta were grey partridge (Perdix perdix) (at 5.79% of total), jackrabbits, weasels and owls. Richardson\\'s ground squirrels (Urocitellus richardsonii) were consumed heavily in the Alberta study in a brief converged times of hibernation emergence and overwintering snowy owls. The sexual dimorphism in prey selection was also studied here, with male owls mainly focusing exclusively on the small rodents, females also took the same rodents but supplemented the diet with all alternate and larger prey. Overall, the meadow and montane voles (Microtus montanus) constituted 99% of over 4500 prey items in Montana. In Horicon Marsh in winter, 78% of the diet was meadow vole, with 14% being muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), 6% ducks and smaller balances of rats and other birds. Snowy owls found in Michigan took meadow voles for 86% of the diet, white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) for 10.3% and northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) for 3.2%. Of 127 stomachs in New England in four irruptive winters from 1927 to 1942, of 155 prey items, 24.5% were brown rats, 11.6% were meadow voles and 10.3% were dovekie (Alle alle), with a smaller balance of snowshoe hare and birds from snow buntings to American black ducks (Anas rubripes). During the same years, stomach contents in Ontario included 40 identified prey items, led by brown rats (20%), white-footed mice (17.5%) and meadow voles (15%); of 81 prey items from Pennsylvania in 60 stomachs that were not empty, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) (32%), meadow vole (11.1%), domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) (11.1%) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) (5%) were the most often identified prey species. Introduced common pheasants were found to be somewhat more vulnerable than native American gamebirds like ruffed grouse due to their tendency to crouch rather than flush when approached by a flighted predator like the snowy owl in a glade or field. Some snowy owls wintering on rocky coasts and jetties were known in New England to live almost entirely off of purple sandpipers (Calidris maritima). The availability of brown rats may draw snowy owls to seemingly unattractive settings such as garbage dumps and under bridges. Meanwhile, snowy owls wintering in Lowell, Massachusetts were seen to live largely off of rock doves (Columba livia) caught off of buildings. Of 87 prey from stomachs in Maine, 35% were rats or mice, 20% were snowshoe hares and 10% were passerines. A small study of 20 prey items in an irruptive winter in Kansas found that 35% of the prey were red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), 15% prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and 10% each by American coot (Fulica americana) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). On the isle of St. Kilda, 24 pellets were found for non-breeding snowy owls that stayed through the early summer. Of 46 prey items, the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis) was predominant by number at 69.6% but constituted 16.8% of biomass while adult Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) constituted 63.5% of the prey biomass and 26% by number (rest of the balance being juvenile puffins and great skuas (Stercorarius skua)).Miles, W. T. S., & Money, S. (2008). Behaviour and diet of non-breeding Snowy Owls on St Kilda. Scottish Birds, 28, 11. The main subspecies of wood mouse was similarly dominant in the diet within County Mayo, Ireland and were presumably snatched at night due to their strict nocturnality. In Knockando, the winter diet was led by European rabbits (40.1%), red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) (26.4%) and adult mountain hare (Lepus timidus) (20.9%) (in 156 pellets); in Ben Macdui, the diet was led by rock ptarmigan (72.3%), field voles (Microtus agrestis) and juvenile mountain hare (8.5%) (33 pellets); in Cabrach, the diet was led by red grouse (40%), mountain hare (20%) and European rabbit (15%) (16 pellets). Among 110 prey items found for snowy owls found wintering during irruption in southern Finland, all but 1 prey item were field voles (the only other prey being a single long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis)). Far to the east, wintering owls in the Irkutsky District were found to subsist mostly on narrow-headed voles (Microtus gregalis).Maleev, V.G. & Popov, V. V. (2007). Birds of forest-steppes of the Upper Angara river basin. Irkutsk. In a wintering population in Kurgaldga Nature Reserve of Kazakhstan, the main foods were grey red-backed voles at 47.4%, winter white dwarf hamster (Phodopus sungorus) at 18.4%, steppe pika (Ochotona pusilla) at 7.9%, muskrat at 7.9%, Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis) at 7.9%, grey partridge at 5.3%, and both steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanii) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) at 2.6%. On the Kuril Islands, wintering snowy owls main foods were reported as tundra voles, brown rats, ermines and whimbrel, in roughly that order. Data from the Logan Airport in over 6,000 pellets shows that meadow vole and brown rat predominated the diet in the area, supplanted by assorted birds both small and large. American black ducks were primarily taken among bird species with other birds taken here including relatively large and diverse species Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brants, American herring gulls (Larus argentatus), double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), in addition to some formidable mammals such as house cat, American mink (Mustela vision), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Given the large size of some of this prey, it can be projected that the snowy owl can kill adult prey of around twice their own weight (i.e. geese, cats, skunks, etc.). Other large prey is sometimes taken by snowy owls, all roughly within the 2 to weight range often include adults of large leporids such as Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), Alaskan hare (Lepus othus), mountain hare and white-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii). As well as several species of geese, probable cygnets of Bewick\\'s swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii)Nagy, S., Petkov, N., Rees, E., Solokha, A., Hilton, G., Beekman, J., & Nolet, B. (2012).

Colorado Mus. Nat. Hist., Popular Ser., 8. Interspecific predatory relationships A waterlogged snowy owl in winter victim to the very swift mobbing of a peregrine falcon. The snowy owl is in many ways a very unique owl and differs from other species of owl in its ecological niche. Only one other owl, the short-eared owl, is known to breed in the High Arctic. However, the snowy owl shares its primary prey, the brown and collared lemmings, with a number of other avian predators. In sometimes differing parts of the Arctic, competing predators for lemmings are, in addition to short-eared owls, pomarine jaegers (Stercorarius pomarinus), long-tailed jaegers (Stercorarius longicaudus), rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus), hen harriers (Circus cyaenus), northern harriers (Circus hudsonius) and generally less specialized gyrfalcons (Falco rusticollis), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), glaucous gulls (Larus hypoboreus) and common ravens (Corvus corax). Certain carnivorous mammals, especially the Arctic fox and, in this region, the ermine, are also specialized to hunt lemmings. Most of the lemming predators are intolerant of the competition given the scattered nature of lemming populations and will displace and/or kill one another given the chance. However, given the need to conserve energy in the extreme environment, the predators may react passively to one another. When unusually breeding south in the Subarctic such as western Alaska, Scandinavia and central Russia, the number of predators with which the snowy owls are obligated to share prey and compete with may be too numerous to name. The taking of the young and eggs of snowy owls has been committed by a large number of predators: hawks and eagles, the northern jaegers, peregrine and gyrfalcons, glaucous gulls, common ravens, Arctic wolves (Canis lupus arctos), polar bears, brown bears (Ursus arctos), wolverines (Gulo gulo) and perhaps especially the Arctic fox. Adult snowy owls on the breeding grounds are far less vulnerable and can be justifiably qualified as an apex predator. Instances of killing of adult snowy owls on the breeding grounds have been witnessed to be committed by a pair of pomarine jaegers on an incubating adult female snowy owl (possibly merely a competitive attack as she was left uneaten) and by an Arctic fox that killed an adult male snowy owl. An early illustration showing snowy owl predation upon a gyrfalcon. When it goes south to winter outside of the Arctic, the snowy owl has a potential to interact with a number of additional predators. By necessity, it shares its wintertime diverse prey with a number of formidable predators. These are known to include their cousins, the great horned owl and the Eurasian eagle-owl. They are relieved of heavy competition from the related species by differing temporal activity, i.e. being more likely to actively hunt in daytime, and by habitat, using rather more open (quite often nearly treeless) habitats than them. During a study of wintering snowy owls in Saskatchewan, the authors indicated that the snowy owls may avoid areas inhabited and defended by great horned owls. Although they usually occurred here outside of an 800 m radius of central great horned owl ranges, they did not avoid the 1600 m radius and different habitat usage may be a dictating factor.Chang, A. M. (2017). Habitat use, movement patterns, and body condition of male and female Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) in winter. Doctoral dissertation, University of Saskatchewan. Given their mildly slighter size, it is unlikely that great horned owls (unlike the larger eagle-owl) would regularly dominate snowy owls in interactions and either species may give way to other depending on the size and disposition of the owls involved. Little study has been undertaken into the trophic competition of snowy owls with other predators during winter and, due to their scarcity, few predators are likely to expel much energy on competitive interactions with them, although many other predators will engage in anti-predator mobbing of snowy owls. Largely in winter, snowy owls have been the victim of a number of larger avian predators, though attacks are likely to be singular and rare. Instances of predation on snowy owls are known to have been committed several times in winter only by Eurasian eagle-owls. Additionally, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been known to prey on snowy owls as well as all northern sea eagles: the bald (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), white-tailed (Haliaeetus albicilla) and Steller\\'s sea eagles (Haliaeetus pelagicus). Snowy owls are also sometimes killed by birds that are mobbing them. In one instance, a peregrine falcon killed a snowy owl in a stoop after the owl had itself killed a fledgling falcon. Anecdotal report indicate predation by gyrfalcons (on snowy owls of unknown age and condition) but it was possibly also an act of mobbing.Heggøy, O., & Øien, I. J. (2014). Conservation status of birds of prey and owls in Norway. NOF/BirdLife Norway-Report, 1, 1–129. In another, a huge throng of Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) relentlessly swarmed and attacked a snowy owl until it meet its demise.Meinertzhagen, R. (1959). Pirates and Predators: The piratical and predatory habits of birds. Oliver & Boyd. Almost certainly more often than being victim of other predators, snowy owls are known to dominate, kill and feed on a large diversity of other predators. Snowy owls, much like other Bubo owls, will opportunistically kill other birds of prey and predators. Although they will readily plunder the nests of other raptorial birds given the opportunity, most predations are on full-grown raptorial birds during winter due to the scarcity of raptor nests in the open tundra. In addition, most competing predators of the Arctic, excepting the very large mammals, are probably vulnerable to a hungry snowy owl. In data from the Logan Airport alone over different winters, the snowy owls were observed to have preyed upon an impressive diversity of other raptorial birds: rough-legged buzzards, American kestrels (Falco sparverius), peregrine falcons, barn owls, other snowy owls, barred owls (Strix varia), northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) and short-eared owls. While owls are likely encountered during corresponding hunting times, it is likely that the swift falcons are usually ambushed at night (much as other Bubo owls will do). In both the tundra and the wintering ground, there are several accounts of predation by snowy owls on short-eared owls. In addition, snowy owls have been known to prey on northern harriers, northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and gyrfalcons. In a few cases, both juvenile and adult Arctic foxes have been known to fall prey to snowy owls. A wintering snowy owl in Saskatchewan was observed to have preyed on an adult red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Predation by snowy owls on red foxes was also reported in the Irkutsky District of Russia. With an adult weight around 6 kg (and far from defenseless), red fox may be the largest known prey known for snowy owls. Besides aforementioned predation on domestic cats and skunks, several members of the weasel family, both small and relatively large, are known to be opportunistically hunted by snowy owls. As a result of its potential predator status, the snowy owl is frequently mobbed at all times of the year by other predatory birds, including fierce dive-bombing by several of the northern falcons on the wintering grounds, including even by the relatively tiny but fierce and very agile merlin (Falco columbarius). The much bulkier snowy owls cannot match the speed and flight ability of a falcon, and may be almost relentlessly tormented by some birds such as peregrines.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'The Harry Potter books by J. K. Rowling, and subsequent films of the same name, feature a female snowy owl named Hedwig. Concern was expressed by some in the media that the popularity of the Harry Potter films would cause an increase in the illicit owl trade of snowy owls. However, there was no strong evidence of an increase in snowy owls confiscated from the black market, despite a larger than typical number of snowy owls being reported at wildlife centres.

       "    {'description': 'The snowy owl can live a long life for a bird. Records show that the oldest snowy owls in captivity can live to 25 to even 30 years of age.Schenker, A. (1978). Höchsalter europaischer Vögel im Zoologischen Garten Basel. Ornithol. Beob. 75: 96–97. Typical lifespans probably reach around 10 years in the wild. The longest known lifespan in the wild was one that initially banded (possibly in its first winter) in Massachusetts and recovered dead in Montana 23 years and 10-month later. The annual survival rate for twelve females on Bylot Island was estimated at around 85–92.3%. It is often reputed that snowy owls frequently died from starvation, with historical accounts frequently opined they \"had to\" leave their breeding grounds due to lemming \"crashes\" but would starve to the south. However, it was proven fairly early on that snowy owls often do survive throughout the winter. This is reinforced somewhat by small radio-tracking and banding studies of the northern Great Plains and the intermountain valleys of the northwestern United States. More circumstance evidence shows a lack of starvation in the eastern part of North America as well. There is evidence that some adults are known to return to the same wintering areas in ensuing years, areas which are far south of their breeding range. At Logan Airport, most snowy owls that are seen appear to be in good condition. Of 71 dead snowy owls found in winter in the northern Great Plains, 86% died from assorted traumas, including collisions with automobiles and other, usually manmade, objects as well as electrocutions and shootings. Only 14% of the 71 deaths were due to apparent starving. Data showed some owls appeared to incur injuries but healed and survived. More evidence was found in wintering snowy owls in New York of healed fractures, though some may require surgery to recover. 537 wintering birds in Saskatchewan were studied based on fat reserves, which were superior in females over males and adults over juveniles; while 31% of females lacked fat reserves, at least 45% of males found starving or in a state of infirmity were males and 63% turned into Wildlife rehabilitation centres were also males. In British Columbia, of 177 snowy owl deaths, of owls to die, only a small percentage were due to natural causes, such as assumed starvation at 13% and 12% were \"found dead\". 1 fledgling on Fetlar dead due to pneumonia and Staphylococcus while a second died from Aspergillosis. Evidence shows that in Utqiaġvik during exceptionally prolonged rains (i.e. 2 to 3 days), nest-departed young in Utqiaġvik were vulnerable to starvation, leading to hypothermia and pneumonia. Due to their natural history, the snowy owl may be effected more severely by blood parasitism than other raptors, due to lowered immunity. Conversely, they appear to have lower levels of ectoparasites like chewing lice than in other large owls per large samples from Manitoba. The snowy owls averaged about 3.9 chewing lice per host against 7.5 for great grey owls and 10.5 for great horned owls.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'This species presence and numbers is dependent on amount of food available. In \"lemming years\", snowy owls can appear to be quite abundant in habitat. Numbers of snowy owls are difficult to estimate even within studies that take place over decades due to the nomadic nature of adults. The population of Scandinavia has long been perceived as very small and ephemeral with Finland holding 0–100 pairs; Norway holding 1–20 pairs and Sweden holding 1–50 pairs. A low breeding population within European Russia has been estimated to hold 1,300–4,500 pairs and Greenland to have 500–1,000 pairs.BirdLife International (2015). European Red List of Birds. Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg Other than northern part of the American continent, a majority of the snowy owl\\'s breeding range is in northern Russia, but overall estimates are not known.Stepanyan, L.S. (1990). Konspekt ornitologicheskoi fauny SSSR. [Conspectus of the Ornithological Fauna of the USSR]. Nauka, Moscow. (In Russian with English summary.). An exact count of 4,871 individuals were seen on surveys between the Indigirka and Kolyma rivers. The numbers estimated by Partners in Flight and other authors by the 2000s was that North America held about 72,500 snowy owls, about 30% of which were juveniles.Rich, T. D., Beardmore, C. J. Berlanga, H., Blancher, P. J., Bradstreet, M. S. W., Butcher, G. S., Demarest, D. W., Dunn, E. H., Hunter, W. C., Iñigo-Elias, E. E., Kennedy, J. A., Martell, A. M.. Panjabi, A. O., Pashley, D. N., Rosenberg, K. V., Rustay, C. M., Wendt, J. S. & Will, T. C. (2004). Partners in Flight North American Landbird Conservation Plan. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. The Canadian population of snowy owls was estimated at 10,000–30,000 (in the 1990s) or even to 50,000–100,000 individuals, perhaps improbably.Reding-License, A. A. (2015).

American Ornithologists\\' Union, Washington, DC, USA. Within Canada, the population on Banks Island was once claimed at up to 15,000–25,000 in productive years and in Queen Elizabeth Islands at about 932 individuals.Miller, F. L. (1987). Snowy Owl numbers on twelve Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canadian High Arctic. Journal of Raptor Research 21 (4): 153–157. Alaska is the only state with breeding snowy owls but has probably quite a bit fewer breeding owls than does Canada.Alaska Department of Fish and Game. State of Alaska special status species 2011. Furthermore, the Partners in Flight and the IUCN estimated that the world population was roughly 200,000–290,000 individuals as recently as the 2000s.PIFSC.

However, in the 2010s, it has been discovered that all prior estimates were extremely excessive and that more precise numbers could be estimated with better surveying, phylogeographic data and more insights into the owl\\'s free-wheeling wanderings. It is now believed that there are only 14,000–28,000 mature breeding pairs of snowy owls in the world. During lemming declines, the number of nesting females may drop down to as low as 1,700 worldwide, a dangerously low number, and the number of snowy owls worldwide is less than 10% of what it was once thought to be. Due to the small and rapidly declining population, the snowy was uplisted in 2017 to being a vulnerable species by the IUCN. A 52% decline has been inferred for the North American population since the 1960s with another even more drastic estimate placing the decline from 1970 to 2014 at 64%. Trends are harder to delineate in Scandinavia but a similar downward trend is thought to be occurring. Snowy owls are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated. Anthropogenic mortality and persecution Snowy owls often favor airports, such as this one at Gerald R. Ford International Airport, in winter but the risk of birdstrike is high in such areas. Of 438 band encounters in the USG banding laboratory, almost all causes of death that could be determined, whether intentional or not, were correlated with human interference. 34.2% or 150 were dead due to unknown causes, 11.9% were shot, 7.1% were hit by automobiles, 5.5% were found dead or injured on highways, 3.9% were collision from towers or wires, 2.7% were in animal traps, 2.1% in airplane birdstrikes, 0.6% were entangled while the remaining 33.3% recovered injured due to assorted or unknown causes. Snowy owls are endangered by heavy airport usage resulting in birdstrikes. Many such collisions are known in Canada and likely also in Siberia and Mongolia . Despite their danger to planes, no human fatalities have been recorded in collisions with this species.Blokpoel, H. (1976). Bird hazards to aircraft: problems and prevention of bird/aircraft collisions. Clarke Irwin;[Ottawa]: Canadian Wildlife Service, Environment Canada: Pub. Centre, Supply and Services Canada. Snowy owls are always far outnumbered in Canadian airports in winter by short-eared owls. However, relative to its scarcity, the snowy accounts for a very large balance of the birdstrikes recorded at American airports due to the attractiveness of the habitat, accounting for 4.6% of 2456 recorded collisions (the barn owl is the most frequently involved in birdstrikes). The species is locally vulnerable to pesticides. The placement of buildings in the Utqiaġvik is now thought to have displaced some snowy owls. In Norway, potential sources of disturbance near the nests include tourism, recreation, reindeer husbandry, motorized traffic, dogs, photographers, ornithologists and scientists. Some biologist have expressed concern that radio-tagging of snowy owls may cause some unclear detrimental effect on snowy owls but little evidence is known if they actually make the owls more susceptible to death. Snowy owls can be quite wary, as they are not infrequently hunted by Circumpolar peoples. Historically, the snowy owl was one of the most persecuted owl species. In the irruption of 1876–77, an estimated 500 snowy owls were shot, with similar numbers in 1889–90 and an estimated 500–1,000 killed in Ontario alone during 1901–02 invasion and about 800 killed in the 1905–06 invasion. Indigenous people of the Arctic historically killed snowy owls as food but now many communities in northern Alaska are fairly modernized, therefore biologists feel that the permitted killing of snowy owls by the indigenous is outdated. The consumption of snowy owls by humans has been proven as far back as ancient cave deposits in France and elsewhere, and they have even been considered as one of the most frequent food species for early humans. They do not shun developed areas especially with old field that hold rodents and, due to lack of human experience, can be extremely tame and unable to escape armed humans. In British Columbia, of 177 snowy owl deaths, the most often diagnosed cause of death was shootings at 25%, often well after legal protection of the species. The number poached snowy owls in Ontario is opined to be unusually high considering their scarcity.Desmarchelier, M., Santamaria-Bouvier, A., Fitzgérald, G., & Lair, S. (2010). Mortality and morbidity associated with gunshot in raptorial birds from the province of Quebec: 1986 to 2007. The Canadian Veterinary Journal, 51(1), 70. While the species was once otherwise killed as food and then later shot out of resentment for perceived threats against domestic and favored game stock, the reasoning behind ongoing shooting of snowy owls into the 21st century is not well-understood. Siberian snowy owls are frequently victim to baited fox traps, with possibly up to around 300 killed in a year based upon very rough estimates. Warfarin poisoning in use as rodenticides are known to kill some wintering snowy owls, including up to six at Logan Airport alone. Mercury concentrations, most likely through bioaccumulation, have been detected in snowy owls in the Aleutian Islands but it is not known whether fatal mercury poisoning has occurred. PCBs may have killed some snowy owls in concentration. Some airports have advocated and instituted the practice of shooting owls to avoid birdstrikes but successful translocation is possible and preferred given the species protected status. A potential high risk of electrocution exists for snowy owls in winter. Climate change is now widely perceived to perhaps the primary driver of the snowy owl\\'s decline. As temperatures continue to rise, abiotic factors such as increased rain and reduced snow are likely to effect lemming populations and, in turn, snowy owls. These and potentially many other issues (possibly including modifying migrating behavior, vegetation composition, increased insect, disease and parasite activities, risk of hyperthermia) are a matter of concern.Inouye, D. W. (2019). \"Climate change in other taxa\". Effects of Climate Change on Birds, p. 257. Additionally, reduction of sea ice, which snowy owls are now known to rely extensively on, as a result of warming climates, impacts could be significant. The effect of climate change was essentially confirmed in northern Greenland where a perhaps irrevocable collapse of the lemming population was observed. From 1998 to 2000, the lemming numbers appeared to have quickly declined. The number of lemmings per hectare (ha) is less than one-fifth of what it once was in Greenland (i.e. from 12 lemmings per ha to less than 2 per ha at peak). This is almost certainly correlated with a 98% decline in owl productivity as well as that of the local stoats (the long-tailed jaeger and Arctic foxes, though previously thought to be almost as reliant on lemmings, seem to be more loosely coupled and more generalized and did not decline as much). The amount of lemming mounds is much less than it once in northern Greenland and any variety of population cycle has been apparently abandoned by what remains of the lemmings.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'The snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Strix scandiaca. The genus name Bubo is Latin for an horned owl and scandiacus is New Latin for of Scandinavia. The former genera name Nyctea is derivation of Greek meaning \"night\". Linnaeus originally described the different plumages of this owl as separate species, with the male specimens of snowy owls being considered Strix scandiaca and the likely females considered as Strix nyctea. Until recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo and the species is now thusly often considered inclusive with that genus.Wink, M. & Heidrich, P. (2000). \"Molecular systematics of owls (Strigiformes) based on DNA-sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene\", pp. 819–828 in: Chancellor, R.D. & Meyburg, B.U. eds. (2000). Raptors at Risk.

(2002). \"The taxonomy and conservation status of the owls of the world: a review\". Ecology and conservation of owls. CSIRO, Collingwood, pp. 343–354. However, some authorities debate this classification, still preferring Nyctea. Often authorities are motivated to retain the separate genus on the grounds of osteological distinctions.Ford, N. L. (1967). A systematic study of the owls based on comparative osteology. PhD diss, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The engraving Snowy Owl, Plate 121 of The Birds of America by John James Audubon. Male (top) and female (bottom). Genetic testing revealed a reasonably distinct genetic makeup for snowy owls, being about 8% genetically distinct from other Bubo owls, perhaps giving credence to those who count the species as separate under Nyctea. However, a fairly recent shared origin in evolutionary history has been illustrated through a combination of genetic study and fossil review and there is little, other than osteology of the tarsometatarsus, to outright distinguish the snowy owl from other modern species like the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). Genetic testing has indicated that the snowy owl may have diverged from related species at around 4 million years ago. Furthermore, it has determined that the living species genetically most closely related to the snowy owl is the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). On a broader scale, owls in general have, through genetic materials, been determined to be a highly distinct group, with outwardly similar groups such as Caprimulgiformes revealed to not be at all closely related. Within the owl order, typical owls are highly divergent from barn-owls. Furthermore, the Bubo genus likely clustered at some point during the evolutionary process with other largish owls, such as Strix, Pulsatrix and Ciccaba, based on broad similarities in their voice, reproductive behaviors (i.e. hooting postures) and a similar number and structure of chromosomes and autosomes. A number, but not all, of extant typical owls seem to have evolved from an ancient shared common ancestor with the Bubo owls. In addition to the question of relationship of the traditional Bubo owls to the snowy owls, ongoing ambiguity of the relationship of other similarly large-sized owls has been persistent. These have sometimes either been included in the genus or within separate genera, i.e. the Ketupu or fish owls and the Scotopelia or fishing owls. Despite the adaptive distinctions, the grouping of these large owls (i.e. Bubo, snowy, fish and perhaps fishing owls) appears to be borne out via research of karyotypes.Owls of the World: A Photographic Guide by Mikkola, H. Firefly Books (2012), The fossil history of snowy owls is fairly well documented despite some early confusion on how to distinguish the skeletal structure of the snowy owls from eagle-owls. It was determined that the snowy owl once was distributed much more widely and far farther to the south during the Quaternary glaciation when much of the Northern Hemisphere was in the midst of an ice age. Fossil records shows that snowy owls once could be found in Austria, Azerbaijan, Czechoslovakia, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sardinia and Spain as well as in the Americas in Cape Prince of Wales, Little Kiska Island, St. Lawrence Island, and in Illinois. In the Late Pleistocene the range expanded southward even more so to Bulgaria (80,000–16,000 years, Kozarnika Cave, W Bulgaria). and much of the Italian Peninsula. Pleistocene era fossil from France, i.e. B. s. gallica, showed that the snowy owls of the time were somewhat bulkier (though still notably smaller than contemporary eagle-owls of the times, which were larger than the eagle-owls of today) and osteologically more sexually dimorphic in size than the modern form (9.9% dimorphism in favor of females in the fossils against 4.8% in the same features today).Andrews, P. (1990). Owls, caves and fossils. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. There are no subspecific or other geographical variations reported in the modern snowy owls, with individuals of vastly different origins breeding together readily due to their nomadic habits. Despite apparent variations in body size, environment conditions are the likely variant rather than genetics. No evidence could be found of phylogeographic variation could be found in snowy owls upon testing. Furthermore, the snowy owl appears to have a similar level of genetic diversity as other European owls.Marthinsen, G., Wennerberg, L., Solheim, R., & Lifjeld, J. T. (2009). Snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) constitute one panmictic population. University of Oslo. Hybrids Snowy owls are not known to interbreed with other owl species in the wild, and accordingly, no hybrids of snowy owls and other owl species have yet been sighted in the wild. However, a hobby falconer in Kollnburg, Germany, bred hybrids from a male snowy owl and a female Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) in 2013.\"Schnuhu\": Überraschende Kreuzung – Ich bin Bayerns süßester Fratz!. tz.de Retrieved on 7 October 2016 The two resulting male hybrid owls possessed the prominent ear tufts (generally absent in snowy owls), general size, orange eyes, and the same pattern of black markings on their plumage from their Eurasian eagle-owl mother, while retaining the generally black-and-white plumage colours from their snowy owl father. The hybrids were dubbed \"Schnuhus\" from the German words for snowy owl and Eurasian eagle-owl (Schnee-Eule and Uhu, respectively). As of 2014, the hybrids had grown to maturity and were healthy.'}],\n",

       "   'descriptions': [{'description': 'Penguins (order Sphenisciformes , family Spheniscidae ) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow it whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average, adults are about 1.1 m tall and weigh 35 kg. The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm tall and weighs 1 kg. Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000\\xa0km south of the equator 35\\xa0mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.'},\n",

Sesamoid Bone 3). Radius 4). Ulna 5). Radial Carpal bone 6). Carpometacarpus 7). Phalanges Taxidermized penguin skin Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins\\' swimming looks very similar to birds\\' flight in the air. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance. All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above. Gentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36\\xa0km (about 22 miles) per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to depths of 170–200 meters (about 560–660 feet). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Emperor penguins are the world’s deepest-diving birds. They can dive to depths of approximately 550 meters (1,800 feet) while searching for food. Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, a movement called \"tobogganing\", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain. Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds; this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis. Gentoo penguin swimming underwater at the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in antarctic environments. However, they have been identified as having at least four different types of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes. The afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to the main feathers and were once believed to account for the bird\\'s ability to conserve heat when under water; the plumules are small down feathers that attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less than 1\\xa0cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers— filoplumes were believed to give flying birds a sense of where their plumage was and whether or not it needed preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but penguins also preen extensively. The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food, leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack. Calculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms suggest that most extant penguins are too small to survive in such cold environments. In 2007, Thomas and Fordyce wrote about the \"heterothermic loophole\" that penguins utilize in order to survive in Antarctica. All extant penguins, even those that live in warmer climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. The flippers of penguins have at least three branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated by blood that has already been warmed and limits heat loss from the flippers. This system allows penguins to efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small animals can survive in the extreme cold. They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages. The great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word penguin was originally used for that bird centuries ago. They are only distantly related to the penguins, but are an example of convergent evolution.Convergence and divergence in the evolution of aquatic birds by Marcel Van Tuinen, Dave Brian Butvill, John A. W. Kirsch and S. Blair Hedges. Isabelline penguins An isabelline Adélie penguin on Gourdin Island Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Chinstrap penguins in Antarctica Breeding Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins.Williams, p. 17 Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species.Williams, p. 57 Agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals. Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only one.Williams, p. 23 With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties. These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea. Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a season. Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 g, the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers\\' weight, and the 450 g emperor penguin egg is 2.3%. The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.Williams, p. 24 When emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to \"steal\" another mother\\'s chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as emperor and king penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches.'},\n",

In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.

There is some disagreement about this and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone. Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa.

       "    {'description': 'A group of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) in Antarctica The word penguin first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related. The etymology of the word penguin is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, Breton or Spanishpingüino .

Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh , \"head\" and , \"white\", including the Oxford English Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary, the Century Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island () in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). An alternative etymology links the word to Latin , which means \"fat\" or \"oil\". Support for this etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, or \"fat-goose\", and the related Dutch word . Adult male penguins are called cocks, females are hens; a group of penguins on land is a waddle, and a group of penguins in the water is a raft. Pinguinus Since 1871, the Latin word Pinguinus has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk (Pinguinus impennis, meaning \"penguin without flight feathers\"), which became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus Pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks (Alcidae), within the order of the Charadriiformes. The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks, and are not closely related to the great auk. They do not belong in the genus Pinguinus, and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auk. They were classified in 1831 by Charles Bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.'},\n",

An Adélie penguin encountering a human during the Antarctic summer Penguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. They are preyed upon by other birds like skuas, especially in eggs and as fledglings. Other birds like petrels, sheathbills, and gulls also eat the chicks. Dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from Antarctica.Removal of the sledge dogs from Antarctica .

In June 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on New Zealand\\'s Peka Peka Beach, 3,200 km off course on its journey to Antarctica. Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the film of the same name, it was suffering from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from its stomach. Happy Feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web, including a live stream that had thousands of views and a visit from English actor Stephen Fry.

Their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. Some writers and artists have penguins based at the North Pole, but there are no wild penguins in the Arctic. The cartoon series Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with Arctic or sub-Arctic species, such as polar bears and walruses. Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as Happy Feet, Surf\\'s Up and Penguins of Madagascar, all CGI films; March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor penguin; and Farce of the Penguins, a parody of the documentary.

Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon Sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon Pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the Linnean taxon Sphenisciformes, i.e., including any flying basal \"proto-penguins\" to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this is confusing, so the established Linnean system is followed here. Evolution Penguin tracks in the sand on Bruny Island, Tasmania The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography. Although penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005;Supplementary Material the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now. The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than 1500 km apart rather than the 4000 km of today. The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya.The exact divergence dates according to Baker et al. (2006) mentioned in this section are not as precisely resolved, as it appears to be due to uncertainties of the molecular clock used. What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also Flightless cormorant). Basal fossils The oldest known fossil penguin species is Waimanu manneringi, which lived in the early Paleocene epoch of New Zealand, or about 62 mya. While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, Waimanu were generally loon-like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were – as opposed to most other diving birds (both living and extinct) – already adapting to underwater locomotion. Perudyptes from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that, by the Bartonian (Middle Eocene), some 39–38 mya,Contra Baker et al. (2006). primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the process of expanding into Atlantic waters. Palaeeudyptines During the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene (40–30 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed. Nordenskjoeld\\'s giant penguin was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 m tall. The New Zealand giant penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80\\xa0kg or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards. Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae. More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other—which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today – occurred on most Antarctic and Subantarctic coasts. But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the Priabonian (Late Eocene). It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae – whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as is usually done these days (i.e., including Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi). The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5 ft-tall Icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern Peru about 36 mya. In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation that gave rise to the penguin biodiversity of our time. Origin and systematics of modern penguins Modern penguins constitute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. To help resolve the evolution of this order, 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with two previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species have been sequenced. The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene and, geographically, it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. Presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution. The genus Aptenodytes appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins. They have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centred on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some Subantarctic islands today. Pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centred on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as Aptenodytes autapomorphies are, in most cases, fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus\\' extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, Pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the Bartonian,It is likely that, during the Bartonian, there was a near-synchronous but allopatric split between the ancestors of Aptenodytes, Pygoscelis, and the common ancestor of all remaining genera (Baker). but the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20–15 mya. The genera Spheniscus and Eudyptula contain species with a mostly Subantarctic distribution centred on South America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid colouration and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4–2 mya. The Megadyptes–Eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galápagos penguin), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represents a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15–14 mya), but again, the living species of Eudyptes are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene. Geography The geographical and temporal pattern of spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record. The emergence of the Subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the Subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond. Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of crown radiation from the Antarctic continent in the Paleogene, although DNA study favors such a radiation. Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14–12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today\\'s Subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts. Relationship to other bird orders Penguin ancestry beyond Waimanu remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups\\' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either. Humboldt penguins in an aquarium. The penguin is an accomplished swimmer, having flippers instead of wings. What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except for paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what is sometimes called \"higher waterbirds\" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes. Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to Ciconiiformes or to Procellariiformes has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of cormorants and anhingas) may actually be a sister group of the penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes into three. A 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister group of Procellariiformes, from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% CI, 56.8-62.7). The distantly related puffins, which live in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, developed similar characteristics to survive in the Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Like the penguins, puffins have a white chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. But, unlike penguins, puffins can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the Antarctic. Their similarities indicate that similar environments, although at great distances, can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent evolution.'}],\n",

Ihre stammesgeschichtliche Schwestergruppe bilden wahrscheinlich die Seetaucher (Gaviiformes) und Röhrennasen (Procellariiformes).

       "    {'description': 'Der Größen- und Gewichtsunterschied der verschiedenen Pinguinarten ist beträchtlich, Körperbau und Gefieder sind in der Familie dagegen sehr homogen. Größe und Gewicht Der Zwergpinguin (Eudyptula minor) erreicht ausgewachsen eine Größe zwischen 30 und 45 Zentimetern und ein Gewicht von einem bis eineinhalb Kilogramm, dagegen gehört der Kaiserpinguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) mit einer Größe von bis zu 1,20 Metern und einem Gewicht von bis zu 40 Kilogramm zu den größten Neukiefervögeln überhaupt. Dieser Größenunterschied wird durch die Bergmannsche Regel erklärt, für welche die Pinguine ein häufig angeführtes Beispiel sind. Die Bergmannsche Regel besagt, dass Tiere in kälteren Regionen größer sind, da dies zu einem günstigeren Verhältnis von Volumen zu Oberfläche des Tieres und damit zu weniger Wärmeverlust führt. Die meisten Arten sind nur um weniges leichter als das von ihnen verdrängte Wasser, so dass ihnen das Tauchen vergleichsweise leicht fällt. Körperbau mini|Tauchender Humboldt-Pinguin mini|Skelett eines Magellan-Pinguins Der stämmig wirkende Körper der Tiere ist durch seine Stromlinienform und die zu schmalen, aber kräftigen Flossen umgestalteten Flügel deutlich an ein Leben im Meer angepasst. Anders als die ebenfalls flugunfähigen Laufvögel besitzen Pinguine ein Brustbein mit stark ausgebildetem Kiel, an dem die kräftige Flügelmuskulatur ansetzt. Da anders als beim Fliegen in Luft beim Schwimmen unter Wasser wegen des höheren Wasserwiderstands der Flügelaufschwung genauso viel Energie kostet wie der Flügelabschwung, haben die Schulterblätter eine im Vergleich zu anderen Vögeln vergrößerte Oberfläche, an der die für den Aufschwung verantwortliche Muskulatur ansetzen kann. Ober- und Unterarmknochen sind am Ellbogen geradlinig und steif miteinander verbunden, was den Flossen eine große Festigkeit verleiht. Die bei Vögeln sonst hohlen Knochen sind bei Pinguinen dicht und schwer, da eine Gewichtsreduktion zum Schwimmen nicht notwendig ist. Die Oberschenkel sind sehr kurz, das Kniegelenk starr und die Beine stark nach hinten versetzt, wodurch an Land der ungewöhnliche aufrechte Gang hervorgerufen wird. Die mit Schwimmhäuten versehenen großen Füße sind relativ kurz – an Land ruhen die Tiere häufig auf ihren Fersen, wobei ihre vergleichsweise starren Schwanzfedern eine zusätzliche Stütze bilden. Der Schwanz ist meist stark reduziert, seine bei anderen tauchenden Seevögeln wesentlich ausgeprägtere Funktion als Ruder wird in erster Linie von den Beinen übernommen. Der Schnabel ist bei den meisten Arten nicht sehr lang, dafür aber kräftig; eine Ausnahme bilden die Großpinguine (Aptenodytes), deren Schnabel wahrscheinlich in Anpassung an ihre Beutetiere – schnell schwimmende Fische – lang, schlank und leicht nach unten gekrümmt ist. Wärmeregulation Pinguine sind in ihrem Lebensraum zum Teil extremen klimatischen Bedingungen ausgesetzt und haben sich daran durch verschiedene anatomische Merkmale angepasst. Zur Wärmeisolation dient zunächst eine ausgeprägte, oft zwei bis drei Zentimeter dicke Fettschicht, über der sich drei wasserdichte Schichten kurzer, dicht gepackter und gleichmäßig über den ganzen Körper verteilter Federn befinden. Apterien, Hautregionen, in denen keine Federn wachsen, gibt es bei Pinguinen im Gegensatz zu fast allen anderen Vögeln nicht; eine Ausnahme bildet bei manchen tropischen Arten die Gesichtshaut. Die in den Federschichten eingeschlossene Luft schützt im Wasser ebenfalls sehr effektiv vor Wärmeverlusten. Daneben besitzen Pinguine hoch entwickelte Wärmeübertrager in ihren Flossen und Beinen: Das in diese Gliedmaßen einströmende arterielle Blut gibt seine Wärme zu einem großen Teil an das kühlere in den Körper zurückströmende venöse Blut ab, so dass Wärmeverluste minimiert werden. Dies wird als „Gegenstromprinzip“ bezeichnet. Auf der anderen Seite kämpfen einige in tropischen Gewässern beheimatete Pinguinarten eher mit Überhitzung. Um dies zu verhindern, sind ihre Flossen im Vergleich zur Körpergröße verbreitert, so dass die Fläche, über die Wärme abgegeben werden kann, erweitert ist. Bei einigen Arten ist zudem die Gesichtshaut nicht von Federn bedeckt, so dass aufgestaute Wärme im aktiv aufgesuchten Schatten schneller abgegeben werden kann. Manche Pinguinarten verlagern ihre Aktivitätszeit vollständig auf den Abend oder die Nacht. Gefieder mini|Felsenpinguine (Eudyptes chrysocome) Die Farbe des aus zahlreichen kleinen, undifferenzierten, fast haarähnlichen Federn bestehenden Gefieders ist bei fast allen Arten rückseitig ein ins Schwarze spielendes Blaugrau, bauchseitig dagegen weiß. Männchen und Weibchen sehen sich sehr ähnlich, obwohl erstere meist etwas größer sind. Ein besonders auffälliger orangegelber Kopfschmuck zeichnet die meisten Schopfpinguine (Eudyptes) aus. Bei Jungtieren ist das Gefieder meistens einheitlich grau bis braun, bei manchen Arten sind die Flanken und die Bauchseite allerdings weiß gefärbt. Zumeist kurz nach dem Ende der Brutsaison, nach der Aufzucht der Jungen, kommt es bei Pinguinen zur Mauser, dem Austausch des Federkleids. Während dieser Zeit, die je nach Art zwischen zwei und sechs Wochen dauern kann, verbrauchen die Vögel ihre Fettreserven etwa doppelt so schnell wie zuvor. Bei Eselspinguinen (Pygoscelis papua) und Galápagos-Pinguinen (Spheniscus mendiculus) ist die Zeit der Mauser dagegen nicht festgelegt und kann zu jedem Zeitpunkt zwischen den Brutzeiten erfolgen. Nicht-brütende Vögel mausern fast immer früher als ihre brütenden Artgenossen.

Sicht und Gehör Die Augen der Pinguine sind auf scharfe Unterwassersicht ausgerichtet; ihre Hornhaut ist extrem flach, so dass die Vögel an Land leicht kurzsichtig sind. Besonders bei den tief tauchenden Kaiserpinguinen sind die Pupillen des Auges zudem extrem dehnungs- und kontraktionsfähig, so dass sich die Augen sehr schnell auf unterschiedliche Lichtverhältnisse wie sie an der Wasseroberfläche bzw. in 100 Metern Tiefe herrschen, einstellen können. Aus der Pigmentzusammensetzung schließt man, dass Pinguine besser im blauen als im roten Bereich des Spektrums sehen können und eventuell ultraviolettes Licht wahrnehmen. Da rotes Licht schon in den obersten Wasserschichten ausgefiltert wird, lässt dies eine evolutionäre Anpassung vermuten. Die Ohren besitzen wie bei den meisten Vögeln keine äußerlich wahrnehmbaren Strukturen. Sie werden durch besonders kräftige Federn beim Tauchen wasserdicht verschlossen. Bei Großpinguinen ist darüber hinaus der Rand des Außenohrs so vergrößert, dass dieses geschlossen werden kann, so dass Mittel- und Innenohr vor tauchbedingten Druckschäden geschützt sind. Unter Wasser geben Pinguine – anders als an Land, wo sie durch trompetenhafte Rufe und lautes Schnarren miteinander kommunizieren – keine auffälligen Laute von sich. Ob sie ihr Gehör umgekehrt zum Aufspüren von Beute bzw. zur Wahrnehmung von Fressfeinden nutzen, ist unbekannt.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|Adeliepinguine beim Landgang Je nach Größe ernähren sich Pinguine von Fischen, häufig zum Beispiel vom Antarktischen Silberfisch (Pleuragramma antarctica), von Sardellen (Engraulidae) oder Sardinen (in Clupeidae), von Krebstieren wie Krill oder kleinen Tintenfischen, die aktiv auf Sicht gejagt und noch unter Wasser verschluckt werden. Teilen sich unterschiedliche Arten denselben Lebensraum, so haben sie in der Regel unterschiedliche Nahrungsvorlieben: So verzehren Adelie-Pinguine und Zügelpinguine Krill unterschiedlicher Größe. Die auf Kleinkrebse spezialisierten Arten sind viel stärker auf regelmäßige Beute angewiesen als die fischjagenden Pinguine, benötigen zum Fang allerdings auch weniger Energie: Während letzteren oft ein Erfolg in zehn Versuchen reicht, müssen erstere pro Tauchgang bis zu 16 Kleinkrebse aufspüren – umgerechnet etwa einen Fang in sechs Sekunden –, um ihren Energiebedarf und den ihrer Jungen zu decken. Die Zahl der Tauchgänge pro Jagdzug ist art- und jahreszeitabhängig: Während der Brutzeit beträgt sie bei Zügelpinguinen (Pygoscelis antarctica) mehr als 190, während Kaiserpinguine auf ihren ausgedehnten tagelangen Zügen durchaus mehr als 860 Tauchgänge unternehmen können. Während der Mauser und bei Großpinguinen (Aptenodytes), Adeliepinguinen (Pygoscelis adeliae), Zügelpinguinen (Pygoscelis antarctica) und Schopfpinguinen (Eudyptes) auch in der Brutsaison müssen viele Pinguine ganz auf Nahrung verzichten. Die Fastenzeit ist bei den einzelnen Arten unterschiedlich lang und beträgt etwa einen Monat bei den Adelie- und Schopfpinguinen, kann bei männlichen Kaiserpinguinen aber mehr als dreieinhalb Monate andauern. Während dieser Zeit können sie bis zu knapp der Hälfte ihres Körpergewichtes verlieren, da die Vögel ihre Stoffwechselenergie dann aus den vor der Mauser- bzw. Brutsaison aufgebauten Fettreserven beziehen müssen. Bei Eselspinguinen (Pygoscelis papua), Gelbaugenpinguinen (Megadyptes antipodes), Zwergpinguinen (Eudyptula minor) oder Brillenpinguinen (Spheniscus demersus) wechseln sich Männchen und Weibchen dagegen beim Brüten ab, so dass sie nur während der Mauser auf ihre Fettreserven zurückgreifen müssen.

       "    {'description': 'Das deutsche Wort Pinguin stammt direkt von dem englischen Wort penguin ab. Diese Bezeichnung bezog sich ursprünglich auf den auf der Nordhalbkugel im Atlantik beheimateten, um 1850 ausgerotteten flugunfähigen Riesenalk (Pinguinus impennis). Die ersten Aufzeichnungen über Pinguine aus dem späten 15. Jahrhundert in Afrika und dem frühen 16. Jahrhundert in Südamerika verwenden den Namen Pinguin noch nicht. Obwohl nicht näher mit dem Riesenalk verwandt, wurde die Bezeichnung vermutlich von Seeleuten in der zweiten Hälfte des 16. Jahrhunderts auf die oberflächlich ähnlich aussehenden Pinguine übertragen. Die Herkunft des englischen Wortes penguin ist umstritten. Es leitet sich vermutlich von walisisch pen gwyn „weißer Kopf“ her. Im Gegensatz zu Pinguinen haben die Riesenalke zwei weiße Flecken am Kopf. Es wurde auch gemutmaßt, dass sich die Bezeichnung „weißer Kopf“ nicht auf den überwiegend dunklen Kopf der Riesenalke, sondern auf die durch Guano weiß gefärbten Inseln mit Brutkolonien der Vögel beziehen könnte. Eine weitere Theorie leitet den Namen von lat. pinguis „fett“ ab, was sich auf den Körperbau der Tiere beziehen würde. (Im Niederländischen ist vetgans, wörtlich „Fettgans“, ein Synonym für pinguïn.) Es wurden auch noch englisch pin-wing sowie Sprachen amerikanischer Ureinwohner als möglicher Ursprung diskutiert. Keine der Theorien konnte bislang schlüssig belegt werden. Auch im Deutschen war vor dem 20. Jahrhundert die Bezeichnung Fettgans üblich.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|links|Zügelpinguin beim „Delfinschwimmen“ Die von Pinguinen durchschnittlich beim Schwimmen erreichte Geschwindigkeit beträgt Messungen zufolge etwa fünf bis zehn Kilometer pro Stunde, obwohl in kurzzeitigen Sprints auch höhere Geschwindigkeiten denkbar sind. Eine besonders schnelle Fortbewegungsart ist das „Delfinschwimmen“; dabei verlässt das Tier wie ein Delfin sprungartig jeweils kurzzeitig das Wasser. Die Gründe für dieses Verhalten liegen noch im Dunkeln: Möglicherweise nutzt es den in der Luft niedrigeren Strömungswiderstand, vielleicht dient es aber auch dazu, Fressfeinde zu verwirren. Beim Tauchen legen manche Pinguine erstaunliche Leistungen an den Tag: Während die kleineren Arten wie der Eselspinguin (Pygoscelis papua) meist nur für etwa eine, selten mehr als zwei Minuten abtauchen und dann auch „nur“ Tiefen von etwa 20\\xa0Metern erreichen, sind bei Kaiserpinguinen länger als 18\\xa0Minuten andauernde Tauchgänge belegt, bei denen schon Tauchtiefen von mehr als 530\\xa0Metern gemessen wurden. Obwohl insbesondere die extremen Leistungen der Großpinguine bis heute nicht richtig erklärbar sind, ist bekannt, dass während des Tauchens der Herzschlag der Tiere auf bis zu ein Fünftel des normalen Ruhewertes herabgesetzt sein kann, was den Sauerstoffverbrauch verringert und damit die mit derselben Menge Atemluft mögliche Tauchzeit vervielfacht. Die Druck- und Temperaturregulation bei tiefen Tauchgängen ist dagegen zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts noch eine Herausforderung für die Forschung. Beim Verlassen des Wassers können Pinguine durch Sprünge Höhen von bis zu 1,80\\xa0Metern überwinden. Durch ihre verhältnismäßig kurzen Beine bewegen sie sich an Land meist watschelnd fort, eine Fortbewegungsart, die, wie biomechanische Studien ergeben haben, allerdings überraschend energieeffizient ist. Auf dem Eis können sie dagegen auch sehr schnell vorwärtskommen, indem sie auf dem Bauch bergabwärts schlittern. Manche Arten legen zwischen ihren Brutkolonien und dem Meer kilometerlange Wege zurück.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|Königspinguine In welchem Alter Pinguine den ersten Anlauf zur Fortpflanzung unternehmen, hängt zum einen von der Art, zum anderen auch vom Geschlecht ab. So brüten Zwerg-, Gelbaugen-, Esels- und Brillenpinguine erstmals mit zwei Jahren; die Weibchen von Adelie-, Zügel-, Königs- und Kaiserpinguinen beginnen meist ein Jahr später mit dem ersten Brutversuch, während die Männchen dieser Arten noch zwölf weitere Monate mit der Fortpflanzung warten. Goldschopfpinguine brüten sogar erst im Alter von fünf Jahren. Bei den vorstehenden Angaben handelt es sich um statistische Mittelwerte: In der Praxis kommt es mit zunehmendem Alter zu immer längeren Aufenthalten in der Brutkolonie, bis schließlich das Brutverhalten selbst einsetzt. So besuchen zum Beispiel bei den Königspinguinen nur wenige Einjährige überhaupt die Kolonie; auch in ihrem zweiten Lebensjahr erscheinen die Tiere dort oft nur für ein paar Tage. In den Folgejahren verschiebt sich das erste Auftauchen in der Kolonie jedoch nicht nur von Mal zu Mal nach vorne, sondern auch die Verweildauer steigt mit zunehmendem Alter deutlich an. Bei Männchen der Großpinguine ist es durchaus nicht ungewöhnlich, erst ab dem achten Lebensjahr mit dem Brüten zu beginnen. Der jahreszeitliche Beginn der Brutzeit ist in erster Linie von klimatischen Faktoren abhängig. Während die weiter nördlich lebenden Galápagos-, Zwerg- und Brillenpinguine über das ganze Jahr hin brüten können und Zwergpinguine in Einzelfällen zwei Bruten pro Jahr aufziehen, beginnen fast alle in subantarktischen bis arktischen Klimaverhältnissen lebenden Pinguine grundsätzlich im Frühling oder Sommer mit der Eiablage. Eine bemerkenswerte Ausnahme von dieser Regel stellen die Kaiserpinguine dar, bei denen die Brutzeit im Herbst beginnt. Die Jungen werden dann ausgerechnet während des antarktischen Winters bei Temperaturen von bis zu −40 Grad Celsius aufgezogen – einzigartige Anpassungen an das Leben in der Kälte sind bei ihnen daher überlebenswichtig. Auch die Jungen der Königspinguine überwintern in den (weiter nördlich gelegenen) Brutkolonien. Sie werden in dieser Zeit von ihren Eltern aber nur selten gefüttert, so dass es bei ihnen im ersten Winter zu einem erheblichen Gewichtsverlust kommt. Pinguine sind nicht nur im Wasser, sondern auch an Land sehr gesellige Tiere. Insbesondere die Eiablage, Brut und die weitere Aufzucht der Jungen finden bei vielen Arten synchron in großen Brutkolonien statt, die im Extremfall bis zu fünf Millionen Tiere umfassen können. Bei den nicht permanent siedelnden Arten betreten zur Brutzeit meist als erstes die Männchen die Kolonie und versuchen bei fast allen Arten, sich ein kleines Territorium zu sichern, das allerdings selten mehr als einen Quadratmeter Fläche umfasst. Ihr Sozialverhalten ist somit nestgebunden. Eine Ausnahme bilden lediglich die Großpinguine, die für ihre Eier keine Nester anlegen und nur gegenüber ihren Partnern und ihrem Nachwuchs auffälliges Verhalten zeigen. Darauf versuchen die Männchen durch trompetenhaftes Rufen, ein Weibchen zu gewinnen. Handelt es sich nicht um den ersten Brutversuch, ist dies oft die Partnerin vom letzten Jahr. Die „Scheidungsrate“ ist bei Pinguinen je nach Art unterschiedlich hoch: Die Prozentzahl der Gelbaugenpinguine, die nach einem Jahr einen anderen Partner wählten, liegt mit 14 sehr niedrig; ihre Partnertreue wird auch dadurch unterstrichen, dass zwölf Prozent der Partnerschaften länger als sieben Jahre andauern. Dagegen liegt die jährliche Trennungsrate bei Adeliepinguinen bei mehr als 50\\xa0Prozent, entsprechend sind keine Partnerschaften bekannt, die länger als sechs Jahre überdauert hätten. Es ist bekannt, dass der Bruterfolg des Vorjahres bei der Frage der Partnerwahl eine gewichtige Rolle spielt. Zwischen der Komplexität des Sozialverhaltens und der Mechanismen zur Partnererkennung einerseits und der Koloniegröße andererseits besteht ein enger Zusammenhang: Die Paarungsrituale der in riesigen Kolonien eng beieinander lebenden Adelie-, Zügel-, Esels- und Schopfpinguine sind sowohl visuell als auch lautlich besonders auffällig; die in dichter Vegetation lebenden Gelbaugenpinguine oder die in weit auseinander liegenden Nestern brütenden Zwergpinguine sind dagegen weitaus zurückhaltender. Eiablage und Brutreduktion mini|Kolonie mit Adeliepinguinen Nach der Kopulation, zu der das Männchen auf dem Rücken der Partnerin balancieren muss, erfolgt die Eiablage. Während Kaiser- und Königspinguine ihr jeweils einziges Ei auf ihren Füßen ausbrüten, legen bei allen anderen Arten die Pinguinweibchen im Abstand von drei bis fünf Tagen zwei Eier in ein einfaches Nest, das aus den in der Umgebung vorhandenen Materialien wie Gräsern oder kleinen Kieselsteinen angelegt wird. Die Eifarbe ist weiß oder grünlich. Nicht alle Eier werden erfolgreich ausgebrütet: Gerade bei jungen Paaren kommt es oft gar nicht erst zum Schlüpfen der Jungen; so wurden bei zweijährigen Eltern Schlupfraten von weniger als 33\\xa0Prozent nachgewiesen. Der Bruterfolg steigt dann mit zunehmendem Alter rapide an und erreicht Werte von über 90\\xa0Prozent; erst bei sehr alten Pinguinpaaren fällt er wegen der dann abnehmenden Fruchtbarkeit langsam wieder auf etwa 75\\xa0Prozent ab. Meist ist das erste Ei etwas größer als das zweite, so dass das erste Küken etwas eher schlüpft als sein Geschwisterküken. Die Brutdauer beträgt je nach Art zwischen einem und zwei Monaten. Das erstgeborene Jungtier wird von seinen Eltern bevorzugt und erhält zum Beispiel regelmäßig mehr Nahrung als das zweitgeschlüpfte, welches meist schnell stirbt. Diese sogenannte Brutreduktion ist eine evolutionäre Anpassung an ein begrenztes Nahrungsangebot: Durch den schnellen Tod des zweiten Kükens wird sichergestellt, dass die Überlebenschancen des ersten nicht durch Verteilung der knappen Ressourcen auf zwei Nachkommen herabgesetzt werden. Umgekehrt haben sich die Eltern durch das zweite Ei „rückversichert“, falls das erste Küken frühzeitig umkommen sollte. Während es bei den meisten Arten nur bei knappem Nahrungsangebot zur Brutreduktion kommt und die Dickschnabelpinguine (E. pachyrhynchus) sogar fast immer beide Küken aufziehen, ist bei allen Schopfpinguinen Brutreduktion die Regel. Interessanterweise ist in dieser Gattung das zweitgelegte Ei das größere (der prozentuale Unterschied liegt zwischen 20 und 70\\xa0Prozent), aus dem dann das erste Jungtier schlüpft. Aufzucht mini|Kaiserpinguine mit Jungtieren Die Aufzucht der Jungen lässt sich in zwei Phasen unterteilen: In den ersten zwei bis drei – bei Großpinguinen sogar sechs – Wochen werden das bzw. die Küken permanent von einem Elternteil beaufsichtigt, während der Partner auf Nahrungssuche geht. Sobald die Jungtiere herangewachsen sind, beginnt die „Kindergarten“-Zeit, in der die Jungen sich in Gruppen zusammenschließen, während beide Alttiere versuchen, Nahrung herbeizuschaffen. Je nach Art können solche auch Crèches genannten Gruppen nur einige wenige Tiere aus benachbarten Nestern umfassen wie zum Beispiel bei Zügel- oder Brillen-Pinguinen oder sich aus Tausenden Individuen zusammensetzen wie bei Adelie-, Esels- oder Großpinguinen. Die Fütterungszeiten sind stark artabhängig: Eselspinguine füttern ihren Nachwuchs täglich, Adelie- oder Zügelpinguine nur alle zwei Tage, die Großpinguine oft nur alle vier Tage oder seltener. Allerdings sind bei letzteren die Mahlzeiten dann umso größer. Die Futtermenge ist meist dem Entwicklungsstand der Jungen angepasst, doch immer enorm im Verhältnis zum Körpergewicht: Schon junge Küken kleiner Pinguinarten können leicht 500 g Nahrung pro Fütterung erhalten; Großpinguine geben sogar auf einen Schlag bis zu einem Kilogramm Fisch an ihr Junges weiter. Königspinguin-Junge können nach zwölf Monaten schwerer sein als ihre Eltern. Bei den nicht dauerhaft kolonielebenden Arten wird nach der elterlichen Mauser die Kolonie schnell verlassen, bei den Schopfpinguinen zum Beispiel innerhalb einer Woche. Die elterliche Fürsorge ist damit in aller Wahrscheinlichkeit beendet – von einer Fütterung auf See wurde bisher nicht berichtet, sie ist auch schwer vorstellbar. Bei den Eselspinguinen, die das ganze Jahr über in der Nähe ihrer Kolonie zubringen, kehren die Jungen noch für zwei bis drei Wochen regelmäßig zu ihren Eltern zurück und erhalten dort weiteres Futter; danach sind auch sie auf sich allein gestellt. Lebenserwartung Ihre Überlebenschancen sind in den ersten zwölf Monaten gering. Bei Adeliepinguinen zum Beispiel leben nach dem harten ersten Jahr nur noch schätzungsweise knapp die Hälfte aller Jungen. Ein bedeutender Faktor, der ihre Lebensaussichten maßgeblich beeinflusst, ist der Umfang der in der Brutkolonie angesetzten Fettreserven, der wiederum von der Fütterung durch die Alttiere und damit von deren Jagderfolg abhängt. Die Überlebenswahrscheinlichkeit erwachsener Tiere liegt dagegen wesentlich höher: Sie beträgt bei den kleinen Adeliepinguinen 70 bis 80, bei den Großpinguinen über 90\\xa0Prozent. Pinguine können ein Alter von mehr als 25\\xa0Jahren erreichen.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|Gelbaugenpinguin (Megadyptes antipodes) mini|Pinguine im Zoo Drei Arten, der Kronenpinguin (Eudyptes sclateri), der Gelbaugenpinguin (Megadyptes antipodes) und der Galápagos-Pinguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), werden zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts als vom Aussterben bedroht eingestuft, sieben weitere gelten als gefährdet. Zu dem Gründen zählen der Verlust des Lebensraums, wie zum Beispiel beim Gelbaugenpinguin, dessen Bestände durch zunehmende Landnutzung und menschliche Eingriffe in das Dünensystem Neuseelands bedroht sind. Ausgewilderte Säugetiere stellen ebenfalls eine Gefahr dar, wie beim Galápagos-Pinguin, dessen auf zwei Inseln beschränkte Brutkolonien durch streunende Hunde dezimiert wurden. Darüber hinaus spielen klimatische Veränderungen eine Rolle: Die Populationen der Galápagos-Pinguine wurden in den 1980er und 1990er Jahren durch einen Kollaps der Fischbestände dezimiert, der auf das mit dem Klimawandel in Verbindung gebrachte El-Niño-Phänomen zurückgeführt werden kann. Felsenpinguine (Eudyptes chrysochome), Magellan-Pinguine (Spheniscus magellanicus) oder Humboldt-Pinguine (Spheniscus humboldti) geraten auf ihren ausgedehnten Beutezügen nach Sardellen und Sardinen in subantarktischen Gewässern immer wieder in Konflikt mit der kommerziellen Fischerei, die sich teilweise auf dieselben Arten spezialisiert hat. Während von Seiten der Fischer Klagen über Einkommenseinbußen erhoben werden, verlieren viele Pinguine ihre Nahrungsgrundlage. Es gibt allerdings Bemühungen, diesen Konkurrenzkonflikt unter Berücksichtigung der Interessen der Fischer zu entschärfen. Brillenpinguine und Magellan-Pinguine, deren Kolonien sich am Kap der Guten Hoffnung in Südafrika oder an der Magellanstraße vor Südamerika befinden, leiden besonders unter der Ölverschmutzung, die durch die dort verlaufenden Schifffahrts- und insbesondere Tankerrouten bedingt ist. Verölte Pinguine können zwar eingefangen, gesäubert und wieder in die Freiheit entlassen werden; dies ist jedoch ein sehr zeitraubender und kostenträchtiger Prozess. Sie verfangen sich auch oft in Fischernetzen. Auf der anderen Seite hat die intensive Bejagung der Bartenwale (Mysticeti) und die dadurch ausgelöste Krill-Vermehrung zu einer erheblichen Zunahme bei Zügel- und auch Königspinguinen geführt; die meisten antarktischen Arten gelten wegen der Abgelegenheit ihres Lebensraums als stabil. Pinguine als Forschungsobjekte – Gefährdung durch Markierung und Fehlschlüsse Für einige Aufregung bei Zoologen und Klimaforschern hat die Erkenntnis gesorgt, dass gerade eine für Migrationsuntersuchungen sehr verbreitete Methode, das Anbringen von Markierungsbändern an den Flossen (engl. flipper bands, Flossenbänder) freilebende Pinguine erheblich gefährdet und in ihrer Lebensweise stark beeinträchtigt. So zeigt eine zehnjährige Untersuchung einer Kolonie von Königspinguinen, dass markierte Tiere eine um 16 % geringere Überlebenschance haben und 39 % weniger Küken produzieren als nicht-markierte Pinguine. Eine Erklärung dafür ist, dass die Markierungsbänder durch die andauernde Reibung zu Verletzungen an den Flossen und den umgebenden Körperteilen führen können, beträgt doch die Flossenschlagfrequenz eines mittelgroßen Pinguins während des Schwimmens rund drei Schläge pro Sekunde. Zudem müssen mit Flossenbändern markierte Pinguine ca. 24 % mehr Kraft zum Schwimmen aufwenden als unmarkierte Tiere. Infolge dieser Beeinträchtigung dauert bei ihnen die Futtersuche erheblich länger, und sie treffen im Durchschnitt 16 Tage später an den Brutplätzen ein als die anderen Tiere. Pinguine, wie auch andere Raubtiere an der Spitze der Nahrungskette, werden vielfach als integrative Indikatorspezies herangezogen, um den Einfluss des Klimawandels auf das marine Ökosystem des südpolaren Ozeans zu untersuchen. Die Zehnjahresstudie zeigt jedoch eindeutig, dass markierte Tiere in anderer Weise auf Umweltveränderungen – etwa infolge des wärmeren Klimas – reagieren als nicht markierte. Dies lässt erhebliche Zweifel an der Aussagekraft von Daten zu, die mit Hilfe von Markierungsbändern gewonnen wurden. Mithin sollte nach Ansicht der Forscher die Verlässlichkeit von flossenband-markierten Pinguinen als Indikatoren des Klimawandels und seiner Folgen für das südpolare Ökosystem neu überdacht werden.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Der eigentliche Lebensraum der Pinguine ist das offene Meer, an das sie anatomisch hervorragend angepasst sind. Lediglich zum Brüten und zum Federwechsel kehren sie an Land zurück; dort leben sie an den felsigen Küsten der südlichen Kontinente, in kühlen Wäldern der gemäßigten Zonen, an subtropischen Sandstränden, auf weitgehend vegetationslosen Lavafeldern, subantarktischem Grasland oder auf dem Eis der Antarktis. Während die tropischen Arten standorttreu sind, entfernen sich andere im Winter teilweise mehrere hundert Kilometer vom Ozean, um zu ihren Brutgebieten zu gelangen.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|Riesensturmvogel unter Eselspinguinen (Pygoscelis papua) Aufgrund der meist isoliert gelegenen Brutplätze haben erwachsene Pinguine an Land so gut wie keine Feinde; vom Menschen eingeführte Säugetiere wie Hunde und Katzen stellen allerdings regional eine ernste Bedrohung dar. Pinguine können zur Verteidigung sowohl ihren Schnabel als auch ihre Flossen als wirksame Waffen einsetzen. Küken werden unbeaufsichtigt dagegen schnell zur Beute der Subantarktikskuas (Catharacta antarctica). Diese Vögel und einige Möwen nutzen jede sich bietende Gelegenheit, um Eier zu stehlen. Seeleoparden (Hydrurga leptonyx), Südliche Seebären (Arctocephalus), Australische (Neophoca cinerea) und Neuseeländische Seelöwen (Phocarctos hookeri) sowie Orcas (Orcinus orca) und Haie (Selachii) jagen Pinguine im Meer, insbesondere die angegebenen Robbenarten patrouillieren oft im flachen Wasser vor den Brutkolonien, wo Pinguine ihre hohe Manövrierfähigkeit nicht gut ausspielen können. Es wird geschätzt, dass auf diese Weise etwa fünf Prozent aller Adeliepinguine pro Jahr getötet werden. Daher rührt vermutlich die auf den ersten Blick seltsam anmutende Angst der Vögel vor dem Gang ins Wasser, an das sie doch so gut angepasst sind. Vor dem Losschwimmen nähern sich Pinguine oft in kleineren Gruppen zögerlich dem Ufer, offensichtlich jeder mit dem Wunsch, nicht der erste sein zu müssen, der das Meer betritt (Pinguin-Effekt); oft dauert diese Prozedur bis zu einer halben Stunde. Sobald ein einzelner schließlich genug Mut gefasst hat und ins Wasser springt, folgen alle anderen nach.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'mini|Pinguinmarsch Die erste Begegnung zwischen Menschen und Pinguinen ist aus Australien bezeugt: Archäologische Knochenfunde in Lagerstätten der Aborigines zeigen, dass Pinguine in vorgeschichtlicher Zeit einen Bestandteil der Nahrung dieser australischen Ureinwohner bildeten. In Europa wurden Pinguine erst gegen Ende des 15. und mit Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts durch die Erkundungsfahrten der portugiesischen Seefahrer unter Vasco da Gama und Ferdinand Magellan bekannt. Der erste bekannte Hinweis auf die Vögel entstammt dem Tagebuch Vasco da Gamas vom 25. November 1497, als dieser in der Mossel Bay an der Küste Südafrikas vor Anker lag. Er begegnete dort den heute als Brillenpinguin (Spheniscus demersus) bezeichneten Vögeln. Der Brillenpinguin ist auch die erste wissenschaftlich beschriebene Art, von der sich der lateinische Familien- und Ordnungsname ableitet – er wurde bereits 1758 von dem schwedischen Systematiker Carl von Linné in seinem Werk Systema Naturae behandelt. Fast alle anderen Arten wurden dagegen erst mit der Erforschung des südlichen Ozeans im späten 18. Jahrhundert und 19. Jahrhundert entdeckt. Früher wurden ganze Kolonien durch Einsammeln der Eier für Nahrungszwecke und Abschlachten der erwachsenen Tiere zur Ölgewinnung aus der reichen Fettschicht ausgelöscht. Zudem wurden Pinguine als Brennmaterial für die Tranerzeugung genutzt.Pinguine.net: Die Tranindustrie, Zugriff am 12. November 2010Wayne Lynch: Penguins of the world, Firefly, Ontario 1997, ISBN 1-55209-180-5 Pinguine sind sehr neugierige Vögel und an Land weitgehend furchtlos; sie haben von Natur aus wenig Angst vor Menschen. Die Vermutung liegt nahe, dass sie Menschen lediglich für eine andere Pinguinart halten; diese Auffassung kann naturgemäß nicht wissenschaftlich bestätigt werden. In Mitteleuropa lassen sich Pinguine nur in zoologischen Gärten betrachten. Manche bieten auch sogenannte „Pinguinmärsche“ an, bei denen die Vögel aus ihren Gehegen gelassen werden und unter Begleitung und Beobachtung der Tierpfleger einen kleinen Rundgang um ihr Zuhause unternehmen können. Pinguinmärsche werden beispielsweise in den zoologischen Gärten von Münster und München angeboten, in der Schweiz im Zoo Zürich und im Zoo Basel; der Pinguinmarsch im Zoo von Edinburgh gilt als sehenswert. mini|150px|Linux-Maskottchen Tux Pinguine sind bei Menschen beliebt und können leidenschaftlichen Zuspruch auslösen. Als Grund wird oft die scheinbare Unbeholfenheit der Tiere angeführt: Die hüpfenden, daherschliddernden und watschelnden Vögel wirken auf viele Betrachter erheiternd und unfreiwillig komisch. Das entfernt an weißes Hemd und schwarzen Smoking, also an sehr formelle Herrenkleidung, erinnernde Gefieder verstärkt diesen Eindruck noch. Kühlschränke sind ebenso nach ihnen benannt wie Eishockey-Mannschaften, und auch ein großer englischer Buchverlag tritt unter ihrem englischen Namen Penguin auf. Bis heute scheint dieser Charme nicht verblasst zu sein: Als Linus Torvalds, der Urheber des Free-Software-Betriebssystems Linux, nach einem Maskottchen suchte, entschied er sich mit Tux für einen Pinguin. Umgekehrt war es vielleicht gerade das friedlich-charmante Image, das die Urheber der Comic-Serie Batman dazu bewog, der sinistren Figur des obersten Bösewichts ausgerechnet den Namen Pinguin zu geben. Danny DeVito verkörperte diese Rolle im Jahr 1992 im Film Batmans Rückkehr. Freundlich-friedlich begegnen Pinguine dem Zuschauer dagegen in der Kindertrickfilmfigur Pingu des Schweizer Fernsehens.'},\n",

       "    {'description': 'mini|Kappensturmtaucher aus der Ordnung der Röhrennasen Die Pinguine gehören zu einer Gruppe von See- und Wasservögeln, die sich wohl in der frühen Kreidezeit von den anderen Vogelgruppen trennte und zu der unter anderem die Seetaucher (Gaviiformes) und Röhrennasen (Procellariiformes) gehören. Die Gruppe wurde durch den Vergleich von DNA bestimmt und erhielt im Jahr 2015 die wissenschaftliche Bezeichnung Aequorlithornithes. Kladogramm nach Prum et al.: Die seit dem frühen Tertiär bekannten Fossilien geben nur wenig Einblick in die stammesgeschichtlichen Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse, da schon die frühen Pinguine sich sehr deutlich von allen anderen Vögeln abheben. Allerdings erinnert das Flügelbein (Pterygoid) der ausgestorbenen Gattung Paraptenodytes an den entsprechenden Knochen der Röhrennasen, und der lange spitze Schnabel der Gattung Palaeeudyptes weist Ähnlichkeiten mit den Schnäbeln der Seetaucher auf. Letztere können wie die Pinguine unter Wasser tauchen, erhalten ihren Vortrieb aber durch die Füße und nicht durch Flossen. Es gibt jedoch fossile Hinweise darauf, dass die Vorfahren der Seetaucher sich unter Wasser wie die heutigen Pinguine mit Hilfe ihrer Flügel fortbewegten. Wie die Erscheinungsform der Pinguine entstand, ist unbekannt: Die ersten Pinguinfossilien stammen aus dem Paläozän vor 61 bis 58 Mio. Jahre und wurden unter der Gattungsbezeichnung Waimanu beschrieben.Kerryn E. Slack, Craig M. Jones, Tatsuro Ando, G.L.(Abby) Harrison, R. Ewan Fordyce, Ulfur Arnason, David Penny: Early Penguin Fossils, Plus Mitochondrial Genomes, Calibrate Avian Evolution. In: Molecular Biology and Evolution. Band 23, Nr. 6, 2006, S. 1144–1155 Nur wenig jünger ist Kumimanu. Fossilien, die aus dem Eozän vor 55 Millionen Jahren erhalten sind und auf der vor Antarktika gelegenen Seymour-Insel gefunden wurden, zeigen schon die typischen Pinguinmerkmale. mini|Zwergpinguine Klar ist, dass die Pinguine von fliegenden Vögeln abstammen, die wohl wie die heutigen Seetaucher bereits unter Wasser jagen konnten. Der Flug in Luft und das Schwimmen unter Wasser stellen aber sehr unterschiedliche Ansprüche an den Vogelflügel – als Folge können die fliegenden und tauchenden Vorfahren der Pinguine wenig größer als etwa die heutigen Zwerg- oder Brillenpinguine gewesen sein. Daraus ergibt sich ein – hypothetisches – Szenario, nach dem die Pinguine von einer Population kleiner standorttreuer Meeresvögel abstammen, die bei Wassertemperaturen oberhalb von etwa 15 Grad Celsius in küstennahen Gewässern der Subtropen oder gemäßigten Zone lebten und wie zum Beispiel die Galápagos-Pinguine auf isolierten Inseln nisteten. Im Zuge einer immer besseren Anpassung an das Meer bildeten sich ihre Flügel immer weiter zu Flossen um, während die Beine nach hinten wanderten, um den Strömungswiderstand beim Schwimmen zu verringern. Mit der Spezialisierung auf den Lebensraum Meer und zunehmender Körpergröße ging zwar gleichzeitig ein Verlust der Flugfähigkeit einher und der durch die zurückgesetzten Beine erzwungene Watschelgang an Land gefährdete die Tiere theoretisch auch an Land; dies war jedoch bei Abwesenheit von Fressfeinden kein evolutionärer Nachteil. Das genaue Gebiet, in dem die Entwicklung der Pinguine stattfand, lässt sich heute nicht mehr rekonstruieren, hypothetisch werden aber sowohl Neuseeland als auch die damals noch wesentlich wärmere Antarktis in Betracht gezogen. Unbestritten ist nur, dass die Pinguine auf der Südhalbkugel entstanden sind, da kein einziges Fossil nördlich des Äquators gefunden werden konnte. Warme äquatoriale Meeresströmungen stellten in der Folgezeit dann anscheinend eine unüberwindliche Barriere für die Vögel dar; daneben wird auch die hohe Zahl schneller Raubfische in tropischen Breiten wie etwa Haien als Ursache dafür in Betracht gezogen, dass die Pinguine nie den Äquator überschritten haben. Die weitere stammesgeschichtliche Entwicklung lässt sich nur grob nachvollziehen, auch wenn bis zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts mindestens 17 fossile Gattungen beschrieben wurden. Kein vollständiges Skelett ist erhalten, die meisten Fossilien stammen zudem von großen Vögeln; dies ist vermutlich nur ein Auswahleffekt, der sich durch die wesentlich bessere Fossilisierung ihrer Knochen erklären lässt und wohl keine systematische Bedeutung hat. Die höchste Artenvielfalt der Pinguine wurde im Tertiär, insbesondere in den erdgeschichtlichen Epochen des Oligozäns und frühen Miozäns erreicht. Zu dieser Zeit lebten auch die größten Pinguine, die eine Körperlänge von bis zu 1,70\\xa0Metern erreichten. Eine dieser Arten war beispielsweise Pachydyptes ponderosus. Warum die Riesenpinguine schließlich im Miozän ausstarben, ist unbekannt; spekulativ wird die zunehmende Konkurrenz durch Robben (Pinnipedia) und Wale (Cetacea) angeführt: Die Riesenpinguine brauchten zum Tragen des Körpergewichts bei ihren regelmäßigen Landgängen sehr große Beine und Füße, die im Meer nutzlos mitgeschleppt werden mussten – anders als bei den vollständig meereslebenden Säugetieren, die ihre Hintergliedmaßen zu Flossen umbilden oder gleich ganz aufgeben konnten. Etwas früher, vor etwa 25 Millionen Jahren, am Wendepunkt von Oligozän und Miozän, begann auch die durch die Öffnung der Drake-Passage zwischen der Antarktis und Südamerika ausgelöste Bildung des kalten Zirkumpolarstroms, der Antarktika klimatisch isolierte und so eine Absenkung der Wassertemperaturen um mehr als zehn Grad herbeiführte. Als bereits wasserlebende und daher gut wärmeisolierte Tiere waren die Pinguine auf diesen Temperatursturz verhältnismäßig gut vorbereitet, so dass man von Exaptation sprechen kann, in diesem Fall der Nutzbarmachung einer für eine bestimmte ökologische Nische entwickelten Merkmalskombination für eine andere Nische. Die modernen Pinguingattungen tauchen erst im Pliozän vor drei Millionen Jahren auf.'},\n",
       "    {'description': 'Unter den lebenden Pinguinen unterscheidet man insgesamt 18 Arten in sechs Gattungen: Die Langschwanzpinguine (Pygoscelis) sind ohne Ausnahme schwarz-weiß gefiedert und mausern am Ende der jeweiligen Brutsaison. Man unterscheidet drei Arten, den Eselspinguin (P. papua), den Adeliepinguin (P. adeliae) und den Zügelpinguin (P. antarctica), der auch Kehlstreifpinguin genannt wird. Alle Arten sind sehr sozial, der Zügelpinguin bildet auf Deception Island mit schätzungsweise fünf Millionen Brutpaaren die größte Pinguinkolonie. Die Großpinguine (Aptenodytes), zu denen man den Königspinguin (A. patagonicus) und den Kaiserpinguin (A. forsteri) zählt, umfassen die beiden größten Pinguinarten. Sie besitzen einen langen, schlanken, leicht gekrümmten Schnabel und jeweils einen charakteristischen orangefarbenen Fleck am Hals. Großpinguine bauen kein Nest; das einzige Ei wird stattdessen auf den Füßen ausgebrütet. Die Schopfpinguine (Eudyptes) umfassen die größte Artenvielfalt. Die Gruppe ist recht divers, zeichnet sich aber durch gelb-orangefarbenen Federschmuck am Kopf aus. Schopfpinguine leben hauptsächlich in den Gewässern um Neuseeland, ihre Kolonien bestehen nur während der Brutsaison. Bei allen Arten kommt es zur obligaten Brutverringerung: Obwohl immer zwei Eier gelegt werden, wird nur ein Jungtier aufgezogen, um eine ungünstige Nahrungsaufteilung, bei der am Ende keines der Jungtiere genug Nahrung erhält, zu vermeiden. Die Gattung der Gelbaugenpinguine (Megadyptes) ist monotypisch, umfasst also nur eine Art, den Gelbaugenpinguin (M. antipodes), der im südlichen Neuseeland brütet. Gelbe Federn weisen auf seine enge Verwandtschaft mit den Schopfpinguinen hin. Die Gattung der Zwergpinguine (Eudyptula) enthält nur eine Art, den Zwergpinguin (E. minor), manche Taxonomen sind jedoch der Ansicht das die Populationen Australiens und Neuseelands jeweils eigenständige Arten darstellen und führen die australische Population unter der Bezeichnung Eudyptula novaehollandiae.S.

Die vier Arten zeichnen sich durch schwarze Streifen an den Flanken, ein charakteristisches schwarz-weißes Kopfmuster und nackte Haut am Kopf aus. Brillenpinguine sind die am weitesten nördlich lebenden Pinguine und sind in tropischen Regionen zuhause.
